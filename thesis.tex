% Throughout my studies I have enjoyed the support of many talented and kind individuals.
% They have provided me with the emotional and academic resources without which I could not have completed the challenges over the course of these six years.
% Those who assisted me in any capacity are innumerable, but the confidence that certain individuals had in me has remained persistent on my mind.

% Firstly, I want to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Daniel McKinsey.
% He offered me an opportunity to begin research immediately, which allowed me to make rapid progress towards my degree.
% I have been supported as a graduate student researcher since early on in my education, which allowed me to participate in LZ projects despite not being on a fellowship.
% Professor McKinsey has given me helpful guidance throughout my education, while allowing me the freedom to experiment and choose my own directions.

% My graduate career began under the guidance of Ethan Bernard.
% His wide range of expertise in matters of hardware can not be overstated.
% Coming from a background of entirely software based projects, the experimental portion of research was intimidating in the first year of graduate school.
% He helped me to develop into a real asset for our group, and was always available to answer my questions on any relevant topic.
% The late nights in the LBL clean room were tough, but Ethan's stoicism was incredibly inspiring to me.

% I want to thank my excellent colleague Quentin Riffard.
% While many of the postdocs, scientists, and students that I have had the pleasure of working with have influenced and inspired me, Quentin stands out in particular.
% His straightforward honesty helped me understand aspects of scientific collaboration and career advancement.
% From his excellent mentorship I felt confident in directing efforts towards areas of research with long term payoffs. 
% He helped me to truly believe that I was making important and unique contributions, and that my value extended beyond them.

% My parents, Donald and Jacinda Watson, deserve immense gratitude.
% They supported me throughout my undergraduate degree, which allowed me to enter into the University of California at Berkeley in the first place.
% During times of self doubt their pride allowed me to visualize holding my future Ph.D.


% Finally, my longtime friends Tyler and Victoria Brehm have supported me from before graduate school even began.
% They have known me from a young age, and they entered medical school together.
% I was able to confide my struggles with them, knowing that they understood the convergence academic and personal aspects which contributed to them.
% Their receipt of their respective medical doctorates filled me with happiness as their friend, and I hope my graduation instills the same feeling with them.
