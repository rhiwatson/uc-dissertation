This work has been undertaken as part of an IAEA co-ordinated research project on "Prompt capture gamma-ray activation analysis". Westcott g-factors for radiative capture cross sections at a temperature of 300K were computed by utilizing the INTER code and ENDF-B/VI (Release 8) library files. The temperature dependence of the Westcott g-factor is illustrated for 113Cd , 124Xe and 157Gd at temperatures of 150, 294 and 400K. Comparisons have also been made of the newly evaluated capture cross sections of 6Li, 7Li, 12C and 207Pb with those determined by the k0 method.},

The LZ collaboration performed an extensive radioassay campaign over a period of six years to inform material selection for construction and provide an input to the experimental background model against which any possible signal excess may be evaluated. The campaign and its results are described in this paper. We present assays of dust and radon daughters depositing on the surface of components as well as cleanliness controls necessary to maintain background expectations through detector construction and assembly.

	abstract = {Maintaining the electric fields necessary for the current generation of noble liquid time projection chambers (TPCs), with drift lengths exceeding one meter, requires a large negative voltage applied to their cathode. Delivering such high voltage is associated with an elevated risk of electrostatic discharge and electroluminescence, which would be detrimental to the performance of the experiment. The Xenon Breakdown Apparatus (XeBrA) is a five-liter, high voltage test chamber built to investigate the contributing factors to electrical breakdown in noble liquids. In this work, we present the main findings after conducting scans over stressed electrode areas, surface finish, pressure, and high voltage ramp speed in the medium of liquid xenon. Area scaling and surface finish were observed to be the dominant factors affecting breakdown, whereas no significant changes were observed with varying pressure or ramp speed. A general rise in both anode current and photon rate was observed in the last 30 seconds leading up to a breakdown, with a marked increase in the last couple of seconds. In addition, the position of breakdowns was reconstructed with a system of high-speed cameras and a moderate correlation with the Fowler-Nordheim field emission model was found. Tentative evidence for bubble nucleation being the originating mechanism of breakdown in the liquid was also observed. We deem the results presented in this work to be of particular interest for the design of future, large TPCs, and practical recommendations are provided.},

	abstract = {The emission spectrum of cryogenic liquid xenon in the vacuum ultraviolet region was measured by irradiating liquid xenon with gamma-rays from a radioactive source. To achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, we employed coincident photon counting. Additionally, the charge of the photo-sensor signals was measured to estimate the number of detected photons accurately. In addition, proper corrections were incorporated for the wavelength; response functions of the apparatus obtained using a low-pressure mercury lamp, and photon detection efficiencies of the optical system were considered. The obtained emission spectrum is found to be in the shape of a Gaussian function, with the center at 57,199±34 (stat.)±33 (syst.)cm−1 (174.8±0.1 (stat.)±0.1 (syst.)nm) and the full width at half maximum of 3328±72 (stat.)±65 (syst.)cm−1 (10.2±0.2 (stat.)±0.2 (sys.)nm). These results are the most accurate values obtained in terms of the data acquisition method and the calibration for the experimental system and provide valuable information regarding the high-precision instruments that employ a liquid-xenon scintillator.},

The energy threshold of the LUX dark matter experiment is primarily determined by the smallest scintillation response detectable, which previously required a 2-fold coincidence signal in its photomultiplier arrays, enforced in data analysis. The technique presented here exploits the double photoelectron emission effect observed in some photomultiplier models at vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. We demonstrate this analysis using an electron recoil calibration dataset and place new constraints on the spin-independent scattering cross section of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) down to 2.5 GeV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$ WIMP mass using the 2013 LUX dataset.

We characterize different electron populations based on their emission intensities and their correlations with preceding energy depositions in the detector. By studying the background under different experimental conditions, we identified the leading emission mechanisms, including photoionization and the photoelectric effect induced by the xenon luminescence, delayed emission of electrons trapped under the liquid surface, capture and release of drifting electrons by impurities, and grid electron emission. We discuss how these backgrounds can be mitigated in LUX and future xenon-based dark matter experiments.},

Perhaps, the only remaining issue to be solved by theory is the so-called "lithium abundance problem". Dedicated experimental efforts to measure the relevant nuclear cross sections used as input of the model have lead to an increased level of accuracy in the prediction of the light element primordial abundances. The rise of indirect experimental techniques during the preceding few decades has permitted the access of reaction information beyond the limitations of direct measurements. New theoretical developments have also opened a fertile ground for tests of physics beyond the standard model of atomic, nuclear, statistics, and particle physics. We review the latest contributions of our group for possible solutions of the lithium problem.},

	title = {High voltage electrode development and the {LZ} experiment's {WIMP} search},
	abstract = {Approximately 15\% of the matter density in the universe is composed of Standard Model particles, while the other 85\% is composed of an enigmatic "dark" matter whose fundamental properties are unknown. In recent decades, there has been substantial interest in performing a direct detection of scattering between dark matter and Standard Model particles, but currently no such signature has been verifiably observed. The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment was built to perform such a direct detection of dark matter using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), which can observe both light and charge signals from an interaction in the xenon. The dual-phase xenon TPC technology is critically dependent on maintaining strong drift and extraction fields in order to observe the charge signal. These fields are established by a set of four stainless steel wire mesh high voltage electrode grids that span the full width of the TPC. During operation, these grids achieve wire surface fields well above 15 kV/cm. These high fields can produce spurious charge signals and signals from real radioactive decays with atypical light-to-charge ratios, both of which can lead to low-energy backgrounds in LZ science data. As a result, substantial effort in the design, construction, validation, and operation of these grids was required to ensure that the LZ detector could be used to pursue world-leading dark matter searches. This work presents a detailed characterization of these efforts, from grid design all the way through first science run data with LZ. This work also presents two analyses performed within the first six months of datataking: the first science run searching for WIMP dark matter, and an analysis of radiogenic backgrounds from the high voltage grids. While the former analysis represents an immediate world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter between about 10 GeV/c{\textasciicircum}2 and 10 TeV/c{\textasciicircum}2, the latter analysis lays a new foundation for the background model needed to search for dark matter at much lower masses, down to approximately 1 GeV/c{\textasciicircum}2},

	abstract = {A critical review is given of the current status of cosmological nucleosynthesis. In the framework of the Standard Model with 3 types of relativistic neutrinos, the baryon-to-photon ratio, \${\textbackslash}eta\$, corresponding to the inferred primordial abundances of deuterium and helium-4 is consistent with the independent determination of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ from observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. However the primordial abundance of lithium-7 inferred from observations is significantly below its expected value. Taking systematic uncertainties in the abundance estimates into account, there is overall concordance in the range \${\textbackslash}eta = (5.7-6.7){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ at 95\% CL (corresponding to a cosmological baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_B h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.021 - 0.025\$). The D and He-4 abundances, when combined with the CMB determination of \${\textbackslash}eta\$, provide the bound \$N\_{\textbackslash}nu=3.28 {\textbackslash}pm 0.28\$ on the effective number of neutrino species. Other constraints on new physics are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {Big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. A brief overview of the essentials of this physics is given, and new calculations presented of light-element abundances through 6Li and 7Li, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. Fits are provided for these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors Nν. Recent developments are reviewed in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff. These measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. A new determination of the primordial helium abundance is included in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions and are consistent with the standard model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of Nν when combined with the CMB baryon density and provides a 2σ upper limit Nν{\textless}3.2. The new precision of the CMB and D/H observations together leaves D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross-section data. In contrast with D/H and 4He, 7Li predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics. This paper concludes with a look at future directions including key nuclear reactions, astronomical observations, and theoretical issues.},

ZEPLIN-III is a two-phase xenon detector which measures both the scintillation light and the ionisation charge generated in the liquid by interacting particles and radiation. The instrument design is driven by both the physics requirements and by the technology requirements surrounding the use of liquid xenon. These include considerations of key performance parameters, such as the efficiency of scintillation light collection, restrictions placed on the use of materials to control the inherent radioactivity levels, attainment of high vacuum levels and chemical contamination control. The successful solution has involved a number of novel design and manufacturing features which will be of specific use to future generations of direct dark matter search experiments as they struggle with similar and progressively more demanding requirements.},

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

	abstract = {Liquid xenon is a leader in rare-event physics searches. Accurate modeling of charge and light production is key for simulating signals and backgrounds in this medium. The signal- and background-production models in the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST) are presented. NEST is a simulation toolkit based on experimental data, fit using simple, empirical formulae for the average charge and light yields and their variations. NEST also simulates the final scintillation pulses and exhibits the correct energy resolution as a function of the particle type, the energy, and the electric fields. After vetting of NEST against raw data, with several specific examples pulled from XENON, ZEPLIN, LUX/LZ, and PandaX, we interpolate and extrapolate its models to draw new conclusions on the properties of future detectors (e.g., XLZD's), in terms of the best possible discrimination of electron(ic) recoil backgrounds from a potential nuclear recoil signal, especially WIMP dark matter. We discover that the oft-quoted value of 99.5\% discrimination is overly conservative, demonstrating that another order of magnitude improvement (99.95\% discrimination) can be achieved with a high photon detection efficiency (g1 {\textasciitilde} 15-20\%) at reasonably achievable drift fields of 200-350 V/cm.},

	abstract = {Measurements of double photoelectron emission (DPE) probabilities as a function of wavelength are reported for Hamamatsu R8778, R8520, and R11410 VUV-sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). In DPE, a single photon strikes the PMT photocathode and produces two photoelectrons instead of a single one. It was found that the fraction of detected photons that result in DPE emission is a function of the incident photon wavelength, and manifests itself below ∼250 nm. For the xenon scintillation wavelength of 175 nm, a DPE probability of 18–24\% was measured depending on the tube and measurement method. This wavelength-dependent single photon response has implications for the energy calibration and photon counting of current and future liquid xenon detectors such as LUX, LZ, XENON100/1T, Panda-X and XMASS.},

We study the properties of these nuggets and compute their profiles and binding energies. Our approach, applicable to both elementary and composite fermionic ADM, utilizes relativistic mean field theory, and allows a more systematic computation of nugget properties, over a wider range of sizes and force mediator masses, compared to previous literature. We identify three separate regimes of nugget property behavior corresponding to (1) non-relativistic and (2) relativistic constituents in a Coulomb-like limit, and (3) saturation in an anti-Coulomb limit when the nuggets are large compared to the force range. We provide analytical descriptions for nuggets in each regime. Through numerical calculations, we are able to confirm our analytic descriptions and also obtain smooth transitions for the nugget profiles between all three regimes. We also find that over a wide range of parameter space, the binding energy in the saturation limit is an \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(1)\$ fraction of the constituent's mass, significantly larger than expectations in the non-relativistic case. In a companion paper, we apply our results to synthesis of ADM nuggets in the early Universe.},

In this work, we predict the experimental background and project the sensitivity of XENONnT to the detection of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The expected average differential background rate in the energy region of interest, corresponding to (1, 13) keV and (4, 50) keV for electronic and nuclear recoils, amounts to \$12.3 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6\$ (keV t y)\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$(2.2{\textbackslash}pm 0.5){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ (keV t y)\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively, in a 4 t fiducial mass. We compute unified confidence intervals using the profile construction method, in order to ensure proper coverage. With the exposure goal of 20 t\${\textbackslash},\$y, the expected sensitivity to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions reaches a cross-section of \$1.4{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-48\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ for a 50 GeV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$ mass WIMP at 90\% confidence level, more than one order of magnitude beyond the current best limit, set by XENON1T.

The phonon signal was read out using a transition edge sensor made of a NbSi thin film. The detector was biased at 66 V in order to benefit from the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke amplification and resulting in a resolution on the energy of electron recoils of 4.46 eVee (102.58 eV at 66 V) and an analysis threshold of 30 eVee. The sensitivity is limited by a dominant background not associated to charge creation in the detector. The search constrains a new region of parameter space for cross sections down to 10−29 cm2 and masses between 32 and 100 MeV⋅c−2. The achieved low threshold with the NbSi sensor shows the relevance of its use for out-of-equilibrium phonon sensitive devices for low-mass dark matter searches.},

	abstract = {The EDELWEISS collaboration has performed a search for Dark Matter (DM) particles interacting with electrons using a 33.4 g Ge cryogenic detector operated underground at the LSM. A charge resolution of 0.53 electron-hole pairs (RMS) has been achieved using the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke amplification with a bias of 78 V. We set the first Ge-based constraints on sub-MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ DM particles interacting with electrons, as well as on dark photons down to 1 eV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$. These are competitive with other searches. In particular, new limits are set on the kinetic mixing of dark photon DM in a so far unconstrained parameter space region in the 6 to 9 eV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$ mass range. These results demonstrate the high relevance of cryogenic Ge detectors for the search of DM interactions producing eV-scale electron signals.},

	abstract = {Recently, some very tight constraints of annihilating dark matter have been obtained from gamma-ray data of the Milky Way and Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. In this article, we report that there are two excellent galaxy clusters (A2877 and Fornax) which can provide interesting constraints for annihilating dark matter. The lower limits of the dark matter mass for the thermal relic annihilation cross section are 25 GeV, 6 GeV, 130 GeV and 100 GeV respectively for the \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$, \${\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}-\$, \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ and \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ channels. For some configuration of our working assumptions, our results improve the Fermi-LAT upper limits of annihilation cross sections by a factor of \$1.3-1.8\$ for wide ranges of dark matter mass for \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$, \${\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}-\$ and \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ channels, and a factor of \$1.2-1.8\$ for \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ channel with dark matter mass \${\textbackslash}le 100\$ GeV. These limits basically rule out most of the existing popular dark matter interpretation of the GeV excess in the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {We detect a weak unidentified emission line at E=(3.55-3.57)+/-0.03 keV in a stacked XMM spectrum of 73 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range 0.01-0.35. MOS and PN observations independently show the presence of the line at consistent energies. When the full sample is divided into three subsamples (Perseus, Centaurus+Ophiuchus+Coma, and all others), the line is significantly detected in all three independent MOS spectra and the PN "all others" spectrum. It is also detected in the Chandra spectra of Perseus with the flux consistent with XMM (though it is not seen in Virgo). However, it is very weak and located within 50-110eV of several known faint lines, and so is subject to significant modeling uncertainties. On the origin of this line, we argue that there should be no atomic transitions in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing possibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter particle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with m\_s=2E=7.1 keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino decay mixing angle sin{\textasciicircum}2(2theta)=7e-11, below the previous upper limits. However, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much brighter than expected in this model. This appears to be because of an anomalously bright line at E=3.62 keV in Perseus, possibly an Ar XVII dielectronic recombination line, although its flux would be 30 times the expected value and physically difficult to understand. In principle, such an anomaly might explain our line detection in other subsamples as well, though it would stretch the line energy uncertainties. Another alternative is the above anomaly in the Ar line combined with the nearby 3.51 keV K line also exceeding expectation by factor 10-20. Confirmation with Chandra and Suzaku, and eventually Astro-H, are required to determine the nature of this new line.(ABRIDGED)},

A ball of asymmetric dark matter accumulated inside a white dwarf and collapsing under its own weight, sheds enough gravitational potential energy through scattering with nuclei, to spark the fusion reactions that precede a Type Ia supernova explosion. In this article we elaborate on this mechanism and use it to place new bounds on interactions between nucleons and asymmetric dark matter for masses \$m\_\{X\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ GeV. Interestingly, we find that for dark matter more massive than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ GeV, Type Ia supernova ignition can proceed through the Hawking evaporation of a small black hole formed by the collapsed dark matter. We also identify how a cold white dwarf's Coulomb crystal structure substantially suppresses dark matter-nuclear scattering at low momentum transfers, which is crucial for calculating the time it takes dark matter to form a black hole. Higgs and vector portal dark matter models that ignite Type Ia supernovae are explored.},

	abstract = {The elastic scattering of an atomic nucleus plays a central role in dark matter direct detection experiments. In those experiments, it is usually assumed that the atomic electrons around the nucleus of the target material immediately follow the motion of the recoil nucleus. In reality, however, it takes some time for the electrons to catch up, which results in ionization and excitation of the atoms. In previous studies, those effects are taken into account by using the so-called Migdal's approach, in which the final state ionization/excitation are treated separately from the nuclear recoil. In this paper, we reformulate the Migdal's approach so that the "atomic recoil" cross section is obtained coherently, where we make transparent the energy-momentum conservation and the probability conservation. We show that the final state ionization/excitation can enhance the detectability of rather light dark matter in the GeV mass range via the \{{\textbackslash}it nuclear\} scattering. We also discuss the coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, where the same effects are expected.},

Considering for the first time a realistic detector model, we simulate the expected supernova neutrino signal for different progenitor masses and nuclear equations of state in existing and upcoming dual-phase liquid xenon experiments. We show that the proportional scintillation signal (S2) of a dual-phase detector allows for a clear observation of the neutrino signal and guarantees a particularly low energy threshold, while the backgrounds are rendered negligible during the supernova burst. XENON1T (XENONnT and LZ; DARWIN) experiments will be sensitive to a supernova burst up to 25 (35; 65) kpc from Earth at a significance of more than 5 sigma, observing approximately 35 (123; 704) events from a 27 Msun supernova progenitor at 10 kpc. Moreover, it will be possible to measure the average neutrino energy of all flavours, to constrain the total explosion energy, and to reconstruct the supernova neutrino light curve.

Assuming the xenon is successively purified to remove radioactive contaminants in 1-tonne batches at a rate of 1{\textasciitilde}tonne/month, the average \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar activity after 10{\textasciitilde}tonnes are purified and transported underground is 0.058--0.090{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$Bq/kg, depending on the degree of argon removal during above-ground purification. Such cosmogenic \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar will appear as a noticeable background in the early science data, while decaying with a 35{\textasciitilde}day half-life. This newly-noticed production mechanism of \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar should be considered when planning for future liquid xenon-based experiments.},

	abstract = {Two-neutrino double electron capture (2νECEC) is a second-order weak-interaction process with a predicted half-life that surpasses the age of the Universe by many orders of magnitude1. Until now, indications of 2νECEC decays have only been seen for two isotopes2–5, 78Kr and 130Ba, and instruments with very low background levels are needed to detect them directly with high statistical significance6,7. The 2νECEC half-life is an important observable for nuclear structure models8–14 and its measurement represents a meaningful step in the search for neutrinoless double electron capture—the detection of which would establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino and would give access to the absolute neutrino mass15–17. Here we report the direct observation of 2νECEC in 124Xe with the XENON1T dark-matter detector. The significance of the signal is 4.4 standard deviations and the corresponding half-life of 1.8 × 1022 years (statistical uncertainty, 0.5 × 1022 years; systematic uncertainty, 0.1 × 1022 years) is the longest measured directly so far. This study demonstrates that the low background and large target mass of xenon-based dark-matter detectors make them well suited for measuring rare processes and highlights the broad physics reach of larger next-generation experiments18–20.},

	abstract = {The measurement of the W value, the average energy expended per ion pair, in liquid argon for internal conversion electrons emitted from 207Bi, is carried out by the electron-pulse method. Comparing with the W value (26.09 eV) for α particles in a gas mixture of argon (95\%) and methane (5\%), the W value in liquid argon is determined to be 23.6+0.5−0.3 eV. This value is clearly smaller than that in gaseous argon (26.4 eV). Such a reduction of W value in liquid argon can be explained by assuming the existence of the conduction band in liquid argon as in solid argon. Under this assumption, the W value in liquid argon is estimated by applying the energy-balance method, which was used for the rare gases by Platzman. The calculated value thus obtained is in good agreement with the experimental result. Following the same method, the W values for liquid krypton and liquid xenon are also estimated.},

The linear power spectra for these models is calculated and compared with the corresponding spectra for cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM) and mixed dark matter (MDM) as well as the power spectrum derived from observations. Our linear analyses suggest that a model universe dominated by a particle whose mass to temperature ratio \$m\_x/T\_x\$ is increased by a factor of two as compared with the standard HDM neutrino gives a reasonable fit to the data on large \$({\textgreater}8h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \{{\textbackslash}rm {\textasciitilde}Mpc\})\$ scales. \$N\$-body simulations for this particular WDM model show features of both HDM and CDM. As in HDM, the first objects to collapse are large pancake-like structures. The final matter distribution is rather smooth and structures as small as galaxy halos are excluded. However, there appear to be virialized rich clusters evident in the CDM but not the HDM simulations. Unfortunately, a simple comparison of the matter distribution and its statistical properties with observations indicates that WDM, like CDM, has too much power at small scales. This is particularly evident in the small-scale pairwize velocity dispersion. The cluster multiplicity function has the wrong shape with too many rich clusters being produced, though this conclusion is based on the simple assumption that light traces mass in groups of galaxies.},

We use an emulator of cosmological simulations, combined with data from the smallest cosmological scales used to-date, to model and search for the imprint of primordial DM-proton collisions.

	abstract = {Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. We briefly overview the essentials of this physics, and present new calculations of light element abundances through li6 and li7, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors, N\_nu. We review recent developments in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom, n\_eff. These measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the primordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are consistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N\_nu when combined with the CMB baryon density, and provides a 2sigma upper limit N\_nu {\textless} 3.2. The new precision of the CMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he4, li7 predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics.},

We review the acoustic phenomenology that forms the cornerstone of the standard cosmological model and discuss internal consistency relations which lend credence to its interpretation.

Nature may contain numerous dark sectors, each with their own beautiful structure, distinct particles, and forces. This review summarizes the physics motivation for dark sectors and the exciting opportunities for experimental exploration. It is the summary of the Intensity Frontier subgroup "New, Light, Weakly-coupled Particles" of the Community Summer Study 2013 (Snowmass). We discuss axions, which solve the strong CP problem and are an excellent dark matter candidate, and their generalization to axion-like particles. We also review dark photons and other dark-sector particles, including sub-GeV dark matter, which are theoretically natural, provide for dark matter candidates or new dark matter interactions, and could resolve outstanding puzzles in particle and astro-particle physics. In many cases, the exploration of dark sectors can proceed with existing facilities and comparatively modest experiments. A rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program has been identified that has the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. These physics opportunities should be vigorously pursued in the US and elsewhere.},

In this white paper, we review several non-minimal dark sector models, including phenomenological consequences: models explaining \$(g-2)\_{\textbackslash}mu\$, inelastic dark matter, strongly interacting massive particles as dark matter candidates, and axions with flavorful couplings. The present exclusions and projected experimental sensitivities on these example dark sector models illustrate the robustness of the growing dark sector experimental effort -- both the broadness and the precision of existing searches -- probing theoretically interesting parameter space. They also illustrate some of the unique complementarity of different experimental approaches.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2008.12587},
	abstract = {Now that conventional weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches are approaching the neutrino floor, there has been a resurgence of interest in detectors with sensitivity to nuclear recoil directions. A large-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have sensitivity below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing the galactic origin of a purported dark matter signal, and could serve a dual purpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first detailed analysis of a 1000 m\${\textasciicircum}3\$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil signal at low energies. We propose a modular and multi-site observatory consisting of time projection chambers (TPCs) filled with helium and SF\$\_6\$ at atmospheric pressure. Depending on the TPC readout technology, 10-20 helium recoils above 6 keVr or only 3-4 recoils above 20 keVr would suffice to distinguish a 10 GeV WIMP signal from the solar neutrino background. High-resolution charge readout also enables powerful electron background rejection capabilities well below 10 keV. We detail background and site requirements at the 1000 m\${\textasciicircum}3\$-scale, and identify materials that require improved radiopurity. The final experiment, which we name CYGNUS-1000, will be able to observe 10-40 neutrinos from the Sun, depending on the final energy threshold. With the same exposure, the sensitivity to spin independent cross sections will extend into presently unexplored sub-10 GeV parameter space. For spin dependent interactions, already a 10 m\${\textasciicircum}3\$-scale experiment could compete with upcoming generation-two detectors, but CYGNUS-1000 would improve upon this considerably. Larger volumes would bring sensitivity to neutrinos from an even wider range of sources, including galactic supernovae, nuclear reactors, and geological processes.},

	abstract = {Experimental observations and theoretical arguments point out that Dark Matter (DM) particles are one of the most prominent component of the Universe. This motivated the pioneer DAMA experiment to investigate the presence of these particles in the galactic halo, by exploiting the model independent signature of the DM annual modulation of the rate and very highly radio-pure apparatus in underground site. In this paper the results obtained by other two annual cycles of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 are presented and the long-standing model-independent annual modulation effect measured by DAMA deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the I.N.F.N. with different experimental configurations is summarized. The improved experimental configuration of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2, \${\textbackslash}simeq\$ 250 kg highly radio-pure NaI(Tl), allowed to lower the software energy threshold. The total exposure of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 over 8 annual cycles is 1.53 ton \${\textbackslash}times\$ yr. DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 confirms the evidence of a signal that meets all the requirements of the model independent Dark Matter annual modulation signature, at 11.8 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ C.L. in the energy region (1-6) keV. In the energy region between 2 and 6 keV, where data are also available from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 (2.86 ton \${\textbackslash}times\$ yr), the achieved C.L. is 13.7 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$; the modulation amplitude of the single-hit scintillation events is: \$(0.01014 {\textbackslash}pm 0.00074)\$ cpd/kg/keV, the measured phase is \$(142.4 {\textbackslash}pm 4.2)\$ days and the measured period is \$(0.99834 {\textbackslash}pm 0.00067)\$ yr, all these values are well in agreement with those expected for DM particles. No systematics or side reaction able to mimic the exploited DM signature (i.e. to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements of the signature), has been found or suggested by anyone throughout some decades thus far.},

	abstract = {The SuperCDMS experiment is designed to directly detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that may constitute the dark matter in our Galaxy. During its operation at the Soudan Underground Laboratory, germanium detectors were run in the CDMSlite mode to gather data sets with sensitivity specifically for WIMPs with masses \$\{{\textless}\}\$10 GeV/\$c{\textasciicircum}2\$. In this mode, a higher detector-bias voltage is applied to amplify the phonon signals produced by drifting charges. This paper presents studies of the experimental noise and its effect on the achievable energy threshold, which is demonstrated to be as low as 56 eV\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{ee\}\}\$ (electron equivalent energy). The detector-biasing configuration is described in detail, with analysis corrections for voltage variations to the level of a few percent. Detailed studies of the electric-field geometry, and the resulting successful development of a fiducial parameter, eliminate poorly measured events, yielding an energy resolution ranging from \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\$9 eV\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{ee\}\}\$ at 0 keV to 101 eV\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{ee\}\}\$ at \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\$10 eV\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{ee\}\}\$. New results are derived for astrophysical uncertainties relevant to the WIMP-search limits, specifically examining how they are affected by variations in the most probable WIMP velocity and the Galactic escape velocity. These variations become more important for WIMP masses below 10 GeV/\$c{\textasciicircum}2\$. Finally, new limits on spin-dependent low-mass WIMP-nucleon interactions are derived, with new parameter space excluded for WIMP masses \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$3 GeV/\$c{\textasciicircum}2\$},

	abstract = {This article presents an analysis and the resulting limits on light dark matter inelastically scattering off of electrons, and on dark photon and axion-like particle absorption, using a second-generation SuperCDMS high-voltage eV-resolution detector. The 0.93 gram Si detector achieved a 3 eV phonon energy resolution; for a detector bias of 100 V, this corresponds to a charge resolution of 3\% of a single electron-hole pair. The energy spectrum is reported from a blind analysis with 1.2 gram-days of exposure acquired in an above-ground laboratory. With charge carrier trapping and impact ionization effects incorporated into the dark matter signal models, the dark matter-electron cross section \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{e\}\$ is constrained for dark matter masses from 0.5--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\} \$MeV\$/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$; in the mass range from 1.2--50 eV\$/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ and the axioelectric coupling constant \$g\_\{ae\}\$ are constrained.

Proposals to explain this line include decaying dark matter\$-\$in particular, that the decay of sterile neutrinos with a mass around 7 keV could match the available data. If this interpretation is correct, the 3.5 keV line should also be emitted by dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way. We used more than 30 megaseconds of XMM-Newton (X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission) blank-sky observations to test this hypothesis, finding no evidence of the 3.5-keV line emission from the Milky Way halo. We set an upper limit on the decay rate of dark matter in this mass range, which is inconsistent with the possibility that the 3.5-keV line originates from dark matter decay.},

	abstract = {We analyze the first two years of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope from the direction of the inner 10 degrees around the Galactic Center with the intention of constraining, or finding evidence of, annihilating dark matter. We find that the morphology and spectrum of the emission between 1.25 degrees and 10 degrees from the Galactic Center is well described by a the processes of decaying pions produced in cosmic ray collisions with gas, and the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons in both the disk and bulge of the Inner Galaxy, along with gamma rays from known points sources in the region. The observed spectrum and morphology of the emission within approximately 1.25 degrees ({\textasciitilde}175 parsecs) of the Galactic Center, in contrast, departs from the expectations for by these processes. Instead, we find an additional component of gamma ray emission that is highly concentrated around the Galactic Center. The observed morphology of this component is consistent with that predicted from annihilating dark matter with a cusped (and possibly adiabatically contracted) halo distribution (density proportional to r{\textasciicircum}\{-gamma\}, with gamma=1.18 to 1.33). The observed spectrum of this component, which peaks at energies between 1-4 GeV (in E{\textasciicircum}2 units), can be well fit by a 7-10 GeV dark matter particle annihilating primarily to tau leptons with a cross section in the range of 4.6 x 10{\textasciicircum}-27 to 5.3 x 10{\textasciicircum}-26 cm{\textasciicircum}3/s, depending on how the dark matter distribution is normalized. We also discuss other sources for this emission, including the possibility that much of it originates from the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.},

It focuses mostly on European efforts, both current and planned, but does it within a broader context of a worldwide activity in the field. It aims at identifying the virtues, opportunities and challenges associated with the different experimental approaches and search techniques. It presents scientific and technological synergies, both existing and emerging, with some other areas of particle physics, notably collider and neutrino programmes, and beyond. It addresses the issue of infrastructure in light of the growing needs and challenges of the different experimental searches. Finally, the Report makes a number of recommendations from the perspective of a long-term future of the field. They are introduced, along with some justification, in the opening Overview and Recommendations section and are next summarised at the end of the Report. Overall, we recommend that the direct search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector target should be given top priority in astroparticle physics, and in all particle physics, and beyond, as a positive measurement will provide the most unambiguous confirmation of the particle nature of dark matter in the Universe.},

	title = {Enhancing the sensitivity of the {LUX}-{ZEPLIN} ({LZ}) dark matter experiment to low energy signals},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08753},
	abstract = {Two-phase xenon detectors, such as that at the core of the forthcoming LZ dark matter experiment, use photomultiplier tubes to sense the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) scintillation signals resulting from particle interactions in their liquid xenon target. This paper describes a simulation study exploring two techniques to lower the energy threshold of LZ to gain sensitivity to low-mass dark matter and astrophysical neutrinos, which will be applicable to other liquid xenon detectors. The energy threshold is determined by the number of detected S1 photons; typically, these must be recorded in three or more photomultiplier channels to avoid dark count coincidences that mimic real signals. To lower this threshold: a) we take advantage of the double photoelectron emission effect, whereby a single vacuum ultraviolet photon has a \${\textbackslash}sim20{\textbackslash}\%\$ probability of ejecting two photoelectrons from a photomultiplier tube photocathode; and b) we drop the requirement of an S1 signal altogether, and use only the ionization signal, which can be detected more efficiently. For both techniques we develop signal and background models for the nominal exposure, and explore accompanying systematic effects, including the dependence on the free electron lifetime in the liquid xenon. When incorporating double photoelectron signals, we predict a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 4\$ sensitivity improvement to the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section at \$2.5\$ GeV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$, and a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim1.6\$ increase in the solar \${\textasciicircum}8\$B neutrino detection rate. Dropping the S1 requirement may allow sensitivity gains of two orders of magnitude in both cases. Finally, we apply these techniques to even lower masses by taking into account the atomic Migdal effect; this could lower the dark matter particle mass threshold to \$80\$ MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$.},

Its large mass of natural xenon provides an exceptional opportunity to search for the double beta decay of \${\textasciicircum}\{134\}\$Xe, for which xenon detectors enriched in \${\textasciicircum}\{136\}\$Xe are less effective. For the two-neutrino decay mode, LZ is predicted to exclude values of the half-life up to 1.7\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{24\}\$ years at 90\% confidence level (CL), and has a three-sigma observation potential of 8.7\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{23\}\$ years, approaching the predictions of nuclear models. For the neutrinoless decay mode LZ, is projected to exclude values of the half-life up to 7.3\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{24\}\$ years at 90\% CL.},

	abstract = {The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment will search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector containing a total of 10 tonnes of liquid xenon within a double-vessel cryostat. The large mass and proximity of the cryostat to the active detector volume demand the use of material with extremely low intrinsic radioactivity. We report on the radioassay campaign conducted to identify suitable metals, the determination of factors limiting radiopure production, and the selection of titanium for construction of the LZ cryostat and other detector components. This titanium has been measured with activities of \${\textasciicircum}\{238\}\$U\$\_\{e\}\${\textasciitilde}\${\textless}\$1.6{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, \${\textasciicircum}\{238\}\$U\$\_\{l\}\${\textasciitilde}\${\textless}\$0.09{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, \${\textasciicircum}\{232\}\$Th\$\_\{e\}\${\textasciitilde}\$=0.28{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\${\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, \${\textasciicircum}\{232\}\$Th\$\_\{l\}\${\textasciitilde}\$=0.25{\textbackslash}pm 0.02\${\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, \${\textasciicircum}\{40\}\$K{\textasciitilde}\${\textless}\$0.54{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, and \${\textasciicircum}\{60\}\$Co{\textasciitilde}\${\textless}\$0.02{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg (68{\textbackslash}\% CL). Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of WIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute only a mean background of \$0.160{\textbackslash}pm0.001\$(stat)\${\textbackslash}pm0.030\$(sys) counts.},

We use the EXO-200 experimental data to measure the absolute scintillation and ionization yields generated by \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ interactions from \${\textasciicircum}\{228\}\$Th (2615{\textasciitilde}keV), \${\textasciicircum}\{226\}\$Ra (1764{\textasciitilde}keV) and \${\textasciicircum}\{60\}\$Co (1332{\textasciitilde}keV and 1173{\textasciitilde}keV) calibration sources, over a range of electric fields. The \$W\$-value that defines the recombination-independent energy scale is measured to be \$11.5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}pm{\textasciitilde}0.5\${\textasciitilde}(syst.){\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}pm{\textasciitilde}0.1\${\textasciitilde}(stat.) eV. These data are also used to measure the recombination fluctuations in the number of electrons and photons produced by the calibration sources at the MeV-scale, which deviate from extrapolations of lower-energy data. Additionally, a semi-empirical model for the energy resolution of the detector is developed, which is used to constrain the recombination efficiency, i.e., the fraction of recombined electrons that result in the emission of a detectable photon. Detailed measurements of the absolute charge and light yields for MeV-scale electron recoils are important for predicting the performance of future neutrinoless double beta decay detectors.},

Following the statisticians, we use the likelihood ratio test to construct a general χ2 statistic, χλ2, which yields parameter and error estimates identical to those of the method of maximum likelihood. The χλ2 statist further useful for testing goodness-of-fit since the value of its minimum asymptotically obeys a classical chi-square distribution.

	abstract = {LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) is a next generation dark matter direct detection experiment that will operate 4850 feet underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, USA. Using a two-phase xenon detector with an active mass of 7{\textasciitilde}tonnes, LZ will search primarily for low-energy interactions with Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are hypothesized to make up the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this paper, the projected WIMP sensitivity of LZ is presented based on the latest background estimates and simulations of the detector. For a 1000{\textasciitilde}live day run using a 5.6{\textasciitilde}tonne fiducial mass, LZ is projected to exclude at 90{\textbackslash}\% confidence level spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections above \$1.4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-48\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ for a 40{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ mass WIMP. Additionally, a \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ discovery potential is projected reaching cross sections below the exclusion limits of recent experiments. For spin-dependent WIMP-neutron(-proton) scattering, a sensitivity of \$2.3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-43\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ (\$7.1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-42\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$) for a 40{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ mass WIMP is expected.

	abstract = {Recently, an anomalous excess was found in the electronic recoil data collected at the XENON1T experiment. The excess may be explained by an axion-like particle (ALP) with mass of a few keV and a coupling to electron of \$g\_\{ae\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-13\}\$, if the ALP constitutes all or some fraction of local dark matter (DM). In order to satisfy the X-ray constraint, the ALP coupling to photons must be significantly suppressed compared to that to electrons. This strongly suggests that the ALP has no anomalous couplings to photons, i.e., there is no U(1)\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm PQ\}\$-U(1)\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm em\}\$-U(1)\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm em\}\$ anomaly. We show that such anomaly-free ALP DM predicts an X-ray line signal with a definite strength through the operator arising from threshold corrections, and compare it with the projected sensitivity of the ATHENA X-ray observatory. The abundance of ALP DM can be explained by the misalignment mechanism, or by thermal production if it constitutes a part of DM. In particular, we find that the anomalous excess reported by the XENON1T experiment as well as the stellar cooling anomalies from white dwarfs and red giants can be explained simultaneously better when the ALP constitutes about 10{\textbackslash}\% of DM. As concrete models, we revisit the leptophilic anomaly-free ALP DM considered in [Phys.Lett.B 734 (2014) 178-182] as well as an ALP model based on a two Higgs doublet model in the supplemental material.},

	abstract = {The motivation for this paper is to review the limits set on the MACHO content of the Galactic halo by microlensing experiments in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud. This has been prompted by recent measurements of the Galactic rotation curve, which suggest that the limits have been biassed by the assumption of an over-massive halo. The paper first discusses the security of the detection efficiency calculations which are central to deriving the MACHO content of the Galactic halo. It then sets out to compare the rotation curves from various halo models with recent observations, with a view to establishing what limits can be put on an all-MACHO halo. The main thrust of the paper is to investigate whether lighter halo models which are consistent with microlensing by an all-MACHO halo are also consistent with recent measures of the Galactic rotation curve. In this case the population of bodies discovered by the MACHO collaboration would make up the entire dark matter content of the Galactic halo. The main result of this paper is that it is easy to find low mass halo models consistent with the observed Galactic rotation curve, which also imply an optical depth to microlensing similar to that found by the MACHO collaboration. This means that all-MACHO halos cannot be ruled out on the basis of their observations. In conclusion, limits placed on the MACHO content of the Galactic halo from microlensing surveys in the Magellanic Clouds are inconsistent and model dependent, and do not provide a secure basis for rejecting an all-MACHO halo.},

	abstract = {Taking seriously the phenomenological indications for supersymmetry we have made a detailed study of unified minimal SUSY, including many effects at the few percent level in a consistent fashion. We report here a general analysis of what can be studied without choosing a particular gauge group at the unification scale. Firstly, we find that the encouraging SUSY unification results of recent years do survive the challenge of a more complete and accurate analysis. Taking into account effects at the 5-10\% level leads to several improvements of previous results and allows us to sharpen our predictions for SUSY in the light of unification. We perform a thorough study of the parameter space and look for patterns to indicate SUSY predictions, so that they do not depend on arbitrary choices of some parameters or untested assumptions. Our results can be viewed as a fully constrained minimal SUSY standard model. The resulting model forms a well-defined basis for comparing the physics potential of different facilities. Very little of the acceptable parameter space has been excluded by CERN LEP or Fermilab so far, but a significant fraction can be covered when these accelerators are upgraded. A number of initial applications to the understanding of the values of mh and mtthe SUSY spectrum, detectability of SUSY at LEP II or Fermilab, B(b→sγ), Γ(Z→b¯b), dark matter, etc., are included in a separate section that might be of more interest to some readers than the technical aspects of model building. We formulate an approach to extracting SUSY parameters from data when superpartners are detected.

The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculations. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

We find that the most powerful constraint is that from \$m\_h\$, followed by the LZ limit on spin-independent scattering, whereas sparticle searches at the LHC and indirect dark matter searches are less restrictive. Most of the surviving CMSSM parameter space features a Higgsino-like dark matter particle with a mass \${\textbackslash}sim 1000-1100\$ GeV, which could best be probed with future direct searches for dark matter scattering.},

This assumption can be tested by studying the perturbations induced by dark matter substructures on cold stellar streams. Here, we study the prospects for discriminating cold from warm dark matter by generating mock data for upcoming astronomical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and reconstructing the properties of the dark matter particle from the perturbations induced on the stellar density profile of a stream. We discuss the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and show that the method should allow to set stringent constraints on the mass of thermal dark matter relics, and possibly to yield an actual measurement of the dark matter particle mass if it is in the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1)\$ keV range.},

It has been possible to separate the elastic scattering from the inelastic in all cases and to resolve the inelastic groups from specific nuclear levels for at least one level in all cases. A simple Born-approximation analysis of the elastic data yields values of the effective radii and surface thicknesses of the nuclear charge densities which (if suitably corrected for failure of the Born approximation) are in substantial agreement with the results of Hahn, Ravenhall, and Hofstadter; i.e., a radius parameter of c≅1.08 A13×10−13 cm (radius to half-maximum of the charge distribution) and a surface thickness of t≅2.5×10−13 cm (thickness from 10\% to 90\% of the maximum of the charge distribution). Phenomenological analysis of the inelastic scattering along the lines laid down by Schiff yields some tentative multipolarity assignments, and application of some results of Ravenhall yields estimates of (radiative) partial level widths; for the E2 transitions these correspond to lifetimes of ∼19×10−13 sec (Mg 1.37 Mev) to ∼1.4×10−13 sec (Sr 1.85 Mev). The observed strengths of the transitions are compared to those predicted by Weisskopf theory.},

We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battle-ground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.},

	abstract = {Observations as early as the 1930s indicated significant disagreements between anticipated
gravitational galactic rotations based upon solar luminous intensity and the observed rotations of
galaxies. The cause of the observed increased rotational velocity in galaxies was ascribed to a
large invisible mass termed dark matter. Various indirect observations affirmed the notion of
dark matter and also suggested that the dark matter consists of non-baryonic material. Dark matter
currently stands as one of the great mysteries in modern physics.
A leading candidate for dark matter is known as the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
(WIMP) which nicely fits dark matter projections. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, located in the Homestake Mine of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF),
was a xenon-based direct detection experiment designed and built for the detection of WIMPs.
LUX had a dual-phase Time Projection Chamber (TPC) which allowed for precise energy and position reconstruction of events. Reanalyzing the LUX data, it becomes possible to search for more
exotic theoretical dark matter forms and new physics.
The Lightly Ionizing Particle (LIP), a theoretical particle with a charge of f · e with f {\textless} 1 and
e the electron charge, arises in a variety of dark matter conceptions associated with additional dark
sectors as well as other physical constructs such as monopoles and quantized charges. This work
seeks to use data from the first underground run of LUX Run03, and reanalyze it to search for
tracks in the detector as a result of LIP interactions. Throughout the reanalysis new techniques in
simulation, data analysis, and data processing are developed, including pulse chopping to separate
merged signals. The LIP search, making use of traditional cut methods as well as machine learning
for event classification, places new limits on LIP flux in the charge range 0.01e to 0.3e as low as

An incident gamma energy range of O(1 keV) to O(1 MeV) and electric fields between 0 and O(10 kV/cm) are incorporated into this heuristic model. We show results from a Geant4 implementation, but because the model has a few free parameters, implementation in any simulation package should be simple. We use a quasi-empirical approach, with an objective of improving detector calibrations and performance verification. The model will aid in the design and optimization of future detectors. This model is also easy to extend to other noble elements. In this paper we lay the foundation for an exhaustive simulation code which we call NEST (Noble Element Simulation Technique).},

	abstract = {The nature of dark matter is one of the most compelling mysteries of modern physics. Liquid xenon detectors have been at the forefront of the attempt to directly detect dark matter particles for the last decade. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment recently concluded its operations at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. During its tenure, LUX set world-leading limits on WIMP dark matter, and paved the way for novel calibration techniques. Due in part to experiments like LUX, the available WIMP parameter space has been dwindling, making experimentalists look to other dark matter candidates. While new technologies will no doubt be needed in the hunt for dark matter, the well-understood detector technology of liquid xenon can be leveraged to search for non-WIMP dark matter. One such candidate, from the general class of dark sector theories, is the Lightly Ionizing Particle (LIP). LIPs interact with regular matter with an effective fractional charge, and the LUX detector is capable of detecting such interactions. New analysis techniques were developed to search for cosmogenic LIPs in the LUX detector, the first such analysis of its kind in liquid xenon. Larger, more sensitive successors to the LUX experiment are already in planning and construction phases. As detectors become more sensitive, previously subdominant effects become more important. Under the umbrella of detector R{\textbackslash}\&amp;D for LUX's more sensitive successor, LZ, a test bed was built to investigate issues that may threaten the sensitivity of future xenon dark matter detectors. Radon backgrounds and the phenomenon of delayed electron noise were studied, revealing new behavior that may help control backgrounds. Delayed electron noise is of special interest, as this phenomenon is the main background for the LIP search.},

The algorithm is based on a statistical test that makes use of an iterative method to recover the photomultiplier tube (PMT) light response directly from the calibration data. The light response functions make use of a two dimensional functional form to account for the photons reflected on the inner walls of the detector. To increase the resolution for small pulses, a photon counting technique was employed to describe the response of the PMTs. The reconstruction was assessed with calibration data including \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{83m\}\}\$Kr (releasing a total energy of 41.5 keV) and \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$H (\${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}-\$ with Q = 18.6 keV) decays, and a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) neutron beam (2.45 MeV). In the horizontal plane, the reconstruction has achieved an \$(x, y)\$ position uncertainty of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$= 0.82 cm for events of only 200 electroluminescence photons and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ = 0.17 cm for 4,000 electroluminescence photons. Such signals are associated with electron recoils of energies \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.25 keV and \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 keV, respectively. The reconstructed position of the smallest events with a single electron emitted from the liquid surface has a horizontal \$(x, y)\$ uncertainty of 2.13 cm.},

	abstract = {We report on the design and performance of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) "Screener", a small liquid scintillator detector consisting of \${\textbackslash}approx 23\$ kg of LAB-based gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator (GdLS) to be used in the LZ Outer Detector. The Outer Detector will be filled with 17.3 tonnes of GdLS and will surround the central liquid xenon time projection chamber of LZ. Its primary function will be to veto neutron single-scatter events in the liquid xenon which could mimic a WIMP dark matter signal. To meet the requirements for the Outer Detector, the radioimpurity levels in the GdLS must be kept below \${\textbackslash}lesssim0.07\$ mBq/kg. This background level corresponds to a rate of \${\textbackslash}approx50\$ Hz above an energy threshold of 100 keV. The Screener was operated in the ultra-low-background environment of the former LUX water shield in the Davis Laboratory at the Sanford Underground Research Facility for radioassay of the GdLS. Careful selection of detector materials and use of ultra-low-background PMTs allows the measurement of a variety of radioimpurities. The \${\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{C\}\$/\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{C\}\$ ratio in the scintillator is measured to be \$(2.83{\textbackslash}pm0.06{\textbackslash}textrm\{(stat.)\}{\textbackslash}pm0.01{\textbackslash}textrm\{(sys.)\}) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-17\}\$. Use of pulse shape discrimination allows the concentration of isotopes throughout the \${\textasciicircum}\{238\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{U\}\$, \${\textasciicircum}\{235\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{U\}\$, and \${\textasciicircum}\{232\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{Th\}\$ chains to be measured by fitting the collected spectra from \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ events. We find that equilibrium is broken in the \${\textasciicircum}\{238\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{U\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{232\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{Th\}\$ chains and that a significant portion of the contamination in the GdLS results from decays in the \${\textasciicircum}\{227\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{Ac\}\$ subchain of the \${\textasciicircum}\{235\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{U\}\$ series. Predictions for the singles rate in the Outer Detector are presented. The rate from radioimpurities above 100 keV in the GdLS is estimated to be \$97.9{\textbackslash}pm6.4\$ Hz, with \$65.5{\textbackslash}pm1.9\$ Hz resulting from \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-decays.},

This picture is dramatically altered if there are significant self interactions within the dark sector, potentially resulting in the coalescence of dark matter particles into large composite blobs. The low number density of these blobs necessitates new detector strategies. We study cosmological, astrophysical and direct detection bounds on this scenario and identify experimentally accessible parameter space. The enhanced interaction between large composite states and the standard model allows searches for such composite blobs using existing experimental techniques. This includes the detection of scintillation in MACRO, XENON and LUX, heat in calorimeters such as CDMS, acceleration and strain in gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and AGIS, and spin precession in CASPEr. These searches leverage the fact that the transit of the dark matter occurs at a speed {\textasciitilde}220 km/s, well separated from relativistic and terrestrial sources of noise. They can be searched for either through modifications to the data analysis protocol or relatively straightforward adjustments to the operating conditions of these experiments.},

This happens due to CP violating scattering of quarks and antiquarks from moving \$Z(3)\$ domain walls. CP violation here is spontaneous in nature and arises from the nontrivial profile of the background gauge field (\$A\_\{0\}\$ ) between different \$Z(3)\$ vacua. We study the effect of this spontaneous CP violation on the baryon transport across the collapsing large \$Z(3)\$ domain walls (which can arise in the context of certain low energy scale inflationary models). Our results show that this CP violation can lead to large concentrations of baryons and anti-baryons in the early universe. The quark and antiquark nuggets, formed by this alternate mechanism, can provide a viable dark matter candidate within standard model without violating any observational constraints.},

	abstract = {Macroscopic nuggets of quark matter were proposed several decades ago as a candidate for dark matter. The formation of these objects in the early universe requires the QCD phase transition to be first order - a requirement that is not satisfied in the Standard Model where lattice simulations reveal a continuous crossover instead. In this article we point out that new physics may supercool the electroweak phase transition to below the QCD scale, and the QCD phase transition with six massless quarks becomes first-order. As a result, the quark nuggets composed of six-flavor quark matter (6FQM) may survive as a viable dark matter candidate. The size of a 6FQM nugget is estimated to be around \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ grams in mass and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ cm in radius. The calculated relic abundance of 6FQM nuggets is comparable to the observed dark matter energy density; therefore, this scenario provides a compelling explanation for the coincident energy densities of dark and baryonic matter. We have explored various potential signatures - including a gravitational wave background, gravitational lensing, and transient photon emission from collisions with compact stars and other nuggets - and demonstrated that the favored region of parameter space is still allowed by current constraints while discovery of 6FQM nugget dark matter may require new experimental probes.},

In this case the system in the bulk, may reach the critical density when it undergoes a phase transition to a color superconducting phase with the ground state being the quark condensate, similar to the Cooper pairs in BCS theory.

	abstract = {In a popular class of models, dark matter comprises an asymmetric population of composite particles with short range interactions arising from a confined nonabelian gauge group. We show that coupling this sector to a well-motivated light mediator particle yields efficient darkleosynthesis, a dark-sector version of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), in generic regions of parameter space. Dark matter self-interaction bounds typically require the confinement scale to be above {\textbackslash}Lambda\_\{QCD\}, which generically yields large ({\textgreater}{\textgreater}MeV/dark-nucleon) binding energies. These bounds further suggest the mediator is relatively weakly coupled, so repulsive forces between dark-sector nuclei are much weaker than coulomb repulsion between standard-model nuclei, which results in an exponential barrier-tunneling enhancement over standard BBN. Thus, dark nuclei are easier to make and harder to break than visible species with comparable mass numbers. This process can efficiently yield a dominant population of states with masses significantly greater than the confinement scale and, in contrast to dark matter that is a fundamental particle, may allow the dominant form of dark matter to have high spin {\textgreater} 3/2.},

The properties of sufficiently large dark nuclei may obey simple scaling laws, and we find that this scaling can determine the number distribution of nuclei resulting from Big Bang Dark Nucleosynthesis. For plausible models of asymmetric dark matter, dark nuclei of large nucleon number, e.g. {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}8, may be synthesised, with the number distribution taking one of two characteristic forms. If small-nucleon-number fusions are sufficiently fast, the distribution of dark nuclei takes on a logarithmically-peaked, universal form, independent of many details of the initial conditions and small-number interactions. In the case of a substantial bottleneck to nucleosynthesis for small dark nuclei, we find the surprising result that even larger nuclei, with size {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}8, are often finally synthesised, again with a simple number distribution. We briefly discuss the constraints arising from the novel dark sector energetics, and the extended set of (often parametrically light) dark sector states that can occur in complete models of nuclear dark matter. The physics of the coherent enhancement of direct detection signals, the nature of the accompanying dark-sector form factors, and the possible modifications to astrophysical processes are discussed in detail in a companion paper.},

There are leading candidates for what the dark matter could be (e.g. weakly-interacting massive particles, or axions), but no compelling observational or experimental evidence exists to support these particular candidates, nor any beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that might produce such candidates. This suggests that other dark matter candidates, including ones that might arise in the Standard Model, should receive increased attention. Here we consider a general class of dark matter candidates with characteristic masses and interaction cross-sections characterized in units of grams and cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$, respectively -- we therefore dub these macroscopic objects as Macros. Such dark matter candidates could potentially be assembled out of Standard Model particles (quarks and leptons) in the early universe. A combination of Earth-based, astrophysical, and cosmological observations constrain a portion of the Macro parameter space.

Although observable consequences would not necessarily survive, it is at least conceivable that the phase transition would concentrate most of the quark excess in dense, invisible quark nuggets, providing an explanation for the dark matter in terms of QCD effects only. This possibility is viable only if quark matter has energy per baryon less than 938 MeV. Two related issues are considered in appendices: the possibility that neutron stars generate a quark-matter component of cosmic rays, and the possibility that the QCD phase transition may have produced a detectable gravitational signal.},

	abstract = {Direct detection experiments search for the interactions of Dark Matter (DM) particles with nuclei in terrestrial detectors. But if these interactions are sufficiently strong, DM particles may scatter in the Earth, affecting their distribution in the lab. We present a new analytic calculation of this `Earth-scattering' effect in the regime where DM particles scatter at most once before reaching the detector. We perform the calculation self-consistently, taking into account not only those particles which are scattered away from the detector, but also those particles which are deflected towards the detector. Taking into account a realistic model of the Earth and allowing for a range of DM-nucleon interactions, we present the EarthShadow code, which we make publicly available, for calculating the DM velocity distribution after Earth-scattering. Focusing on low-mass DM, we find that Earth-scattering reduces the direct detection rate at certain detector locations while increasing the rate in others. The Earth's rotation induces a daily modulation in the rate, which we find to be highly sensitive to the detector latitude and to the form of the DM-nucleon interaction. These distinctive signatures would allow us to unambiguously detect DM and perhaps even identify its interactions in regions of the parameter space within the reach of current and future experiments.},

For large SIMP-nucleon cross sections the sensitivity of traditional direct dark matter searches using underground experiments is limited by the energy loss experienced by SIMPs, due to scattering with the rock overburden and experimental shielding on their way to the detector apparatus. Hence a surface-based experiment is ideal for a SIMP search, despite the much larger background, resulting from the lack of shielding. We show using data from a recent surface run of a low-threshold cryogenic detector that values of the SIMP-nucleon cross section up to approximately \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-27\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ can be excluded for SIMPs with masses above 100 MeV.},

The two necessary conditions, a nonzero dark baryon number asymmetry and a first-order phase transition, can be easily satisfied for many asymmetric dark matter models and QCD-like gauge theories with a few massless flavors. For confinement scales from 10 keV to 100 TeV, these dark quark nuggets with a huge dark baryon number have their masses vary from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{23\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$ and their radii from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}\$. Such macroscopic dark matter candidates can be searched for by a broad scope of experiments and even new detection strategies. Specifically, we have found that the gravitational microlensing experiments can probe heavier dark quark nuggets or smaller confinement scales around 10 keV; collision of dark quark nuggets can generate detectable and transient electromagnetic radiation signals; the stochastic gravitational wave signals from the first order phase transition can be probed by the pulsar timing array observations and other space-based interferometry experiments; the approximately massless dark mesons can behave as dark radiation to be tested by the next-generation CMB experiments; the free dark baryons, as a subcomponent of dark matter, can have direct detection signals for a sufficiently strong interaction strength with the visible sector.},

This realization closes the parameter space for pointlike strongly interacting dark matter.

Consequently, this model has a natural dark matter candidate and a Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum. In addition, the Higgs boson properties are changed with respect to the Standard Model due to the mixing with a new particle. We explore regions in the parameter space taking into account bounds from the measured Higgs properties, dark matter direct detection as well as measurements of the effective number of neutrino species before recombination. The dark matter relic density is determined by three classes of processes: the usual self-annihilation, semi-annihilation and purely dark matter \$3 {\textbackslash}to 2\$ processes. The latter has been subject of recent interest leading to the so-called `Strongly Interacting Massive Particle' (SIMP) scenario. We show under which conditions our model can lead to a concrete realization of such scenario and study the possibility that the dark matter self-interactions could address the small scale structure problems. In particular, we find that in order for the SIMP scenario to work, the dark matter mass must be in the range \$7-115\$ MeV, with the global symmetry energy breaking scale in the TeV range.},

A real scalar field constituting Dark Matter linearly couples to the inflaton. As a result of this interaction, the scalar gets displaced from its zero expectation value. This offset feeds into the energy density of Dark Matter. This mechanism is universal and can be implemented in a generic inflationary scenario. Phenomenology of the model is comprised of Dark Matter decay into inflatons, which in turn decay into Standard Model species triggering cascades of high energy particles contributing to the cosmic ray flux. We evaluate the lifetime of Dark Matter and obtain limits on the inflationary scenarios, where this mechanism does not lead to the conflict with the Dark Matter stability considerations/studies of cosmic ray propagation.},

For strongly-interacting massive particle (SIMP) Dark Matter, however, the accessible cross section is bounded from above due to the stopping effect of the atmosphere, Earth and detector shielding. We present a careful calculation of the SIMP signal rate, focusing on super-heavy DM (\$m\_{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}\$) for which the standard nuclear-stopping formalism is applicable, and provide code for implementing this calculation numerically.

A reanalysis of the longer-exposure, sub-surface CDMS-I results (published in 2002) improves the previous cross section reach by two orders of magnitude, for masses up to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}\$. Along with complementary constraints from SIMP capture and annihilation in the Earth and Sun, these improved limits from direct nuclear scattering searches close a number of windows in the SIMP parameter space in the mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ GeV to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ GeV, of particular interest for heavy DM produced gravitationally at the end of inflation.},

Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results. Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn. In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions.

	abstract = {Fusion research relies heavily on plasma diagnostics in order to operate safely, to explore and optimise the performance of a fusion experiment and to study in detail the plasma physics. In recent years, there have been many advances in plasma diagnostics, not only as a result of the development of new and innovative techniques, but also by the improvement and careful application of well-established methods. A magnetically-confined plasma has many degrees of freedom and is influenced by many boundary conditions. Consequently, to fully characterise a fusion plasma the measurement of a correspondingly large number of plasma parameters is required. Some parameters, such as the magnetic field, current, temperature and density, are fairly obvious requirements, but some are more subtle or complex. Many of these parameters cover very wide dynamic ranges, either in different regions of the plasma at the same time or at different times during the evolution of the plasma. Obvious examples are plasma temperatures, which range from a few electron volts (a mere ten thousand degrees Celsius) in the divertor to tens of kilo-electron volts (a few hundred million degrees) in the plasma core and neutron yields, which range over many orders of magnitude. Usually, such wide ranges cannot be measured with a single instrument or measurement method. Consequently, many parameters require several different diagnostic instruments to cover their whole dynamic range. Moreover, independent methods of measuring the most important parameters, particularly those used for feed back control, are desirable for reliability and to resolve uncertainties in interpretation or interference from other effects. JET commenced operation in 1983 with about 20 diagnostic systems and now has about 70. Even so, some important parameters are not completely diagnosed. Measurements in fusion plasmas utilise a wide variety of techniques. Some methods are passive and use the detection of particles or radiation emitted spontaneously from the plasma, other methods use active probing of the plasma with beams of particles or electromagnetic radiation from an external source. Diagnostics based on electromagnetic radiation are particularly important; fusion plasmas emit electromagnetic radiation over a very wide spectral range, from high energy gamma rays through hard and soft X-rays, ultra-violet, visible, infra-red to microwave radiation. Each wavelength range conveys information about specific aspects of the plasma and coverage of the whole range is necessary. It is impossible in the space of a short paper to cover the wide range of recent diagnostic development. This paper will discuss some of the general principles and requirements. A few examples will be used to illustrate the present state of the art. We will briefly consider the future requirements and challenges of designing diagnostics for ITER and fusion reactors.},

This extraordinary performance is due to three facts: a) the abundant emission of Cherenkov photons by liquid xenon; b) the fact that LXe is transparent to Cherenkov light; and c) the fact that the fastest photons in LXe have wavelengths higher than 300 nm, therefore making it possible to separate the detection of scintillation and Cherenkov light. The CRT in a Cherenkov LXe TOF-PET detector is, therefore, dominated by the resolution (time jitter) introduced by the photosensors and the electronics. However, we show that for sufficiently fast photosensors (e.g, an overall 40 ps jitter, which can be achieved by current micro-channel plate photomultipliers) the overall CRT varies between 30 and 55 ps, depending of the detection efficiency. This is still one order of magnitude better than commercial CRT devices and improves by a factor 3 the best CRT obtained with small laboratory prototypes.},

Two techniques were used for this study; first, the spectral throughput of an integrating sphere irradiated by a deuterium lamp was analyzed by a monochromator. Second, a UV laser beam was directed into an integrating sphere, and spectrally dispersed laser induced fluorescence was studied. Significant absorption and fluorescence features were observed in the UV region and attributed to the contamination in the integrating sphere. We demonstrate that integrating spheres are easily contaminated by environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emitted from engine exhaust. Baking of the contaminated integrating sphere can reverse some but not all of the effects caused by contaminants. The implications for using integrating spheres for UV measurement are discussed.},

	abstract = {High vacuum, cold gases and liquids, and solids are the principal insulating materials for superconducting apparatus. All these insulants have been claimed to show fairly good intrinsic dielectric performance under laboratory conditions where small scale experiments in the short term range are typical. However, the insulants must be integrated into large scaled insulating systems which must withstand any particular stressing voltage seen by the actual apparatus over the full life period. Estimation of the amount of degradation needs a reliable extrapolation from small scale experimental data. The latter are reviewed in the light of new experimental data, and guidelines for extrapolation are discussed. No degradation may be seen in resistivity and permittivity. Dielectric losses in liquids, however, show some degradation, and breakdown as a statistical event must be scrutinized very critically. Although information for breakdown strength degradation in large systems is still fragmentary, some thumb rules can be recommended for design.
An investigation of the electrical breakdown behaviour of liquid nitrogen in the presence of a local hot spot on an electrode has been performed to determine the breakdown mechanism of liquid coolant in cryoresistive or superconducting apparatus under quenching conditions. It has been found that the vapour bubbles are generated at a hot spot and the manner of the vapour generation and the vapour structure depend strongly on the ambient pressure, the heat transfer rate at a hot spot and the applied voltage. Electrical breakdown took place through various series of composites of liquid and gas phases, depending on the pressure and the heating power applied to a hot spot. Therefore, the breakdown characteristic of liquid nitrogen under hot spot conditions depended to a marked degree on these factors.
Cryogenic gases and liquids exhibit interesting dielectric properties. Their resistivities are extremely high, their permittivities are low and their dielectric losses are negligible at low field strengths. The dielectric strength of the gases can be described by means of generalized similarity laws up to field levels of 107 V m−1. Breakdown of liquids is initiated within bubbles. All these properties and mechanisms are well understood in principle. The dielectric strength of very dense gases as well as of liquids is very sensitive to field distortions which are never completely avoidable in practice. Boundary effects have a considerable influence. Weak-linked breakdown mechanisms have to be assumed resulting in size and area effects. Some of the most important experimental results are discussed.},

	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0≤t 1ǐ≤t 2ǐ≤ … ≤t N ǐ. Then P(t)= II. [(N – r)/(N – r + 1)], where r assumes those values for which tr ≤t and for which tr ǐ measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors. * Prepared while the authors were at Bell Telephone Laboratories and Johns Hopkins University respectively.

	abstract = {Large amounts of money are lost each year in the construction industry because of poor schedule and cost control. Few contractors specify and follow systematic schedule monitoring practices. Traditionally, the earned value method (EVM) is used to control and monitor schedule performance using the schedule and cost performance indices which compare the budgeted cost of work performed to what was originally scheduled or what is actually expended. This paper presents a statistical approach, namely Weibull analysis, to evaluate stochastically the schedule performance of construction or design projects. The approach can be used in conjunction with the EVM to enhance the evaluation and control of schedule performance. Weibull analysis is a common method for failure analysis and reliability engineering used in a wide range of applications. In this paper, the applicability of Weibull analysis for evaluating and comparing the reliability of the schedule performance of multiple projects is presented. The various steps in the analysis are discussed along with an example in which two projects are analyzed and compared. The authors conclude that Weibull analysis has several advantages and provides a relatively robust and effective method for construction managers to better control and monitor their projects.},

The somewhat curious name of this formula, which relates the refractive index of a substance to its density, reflects its dual origin in two areas of nineteenth-century physics, namely optics and electromagnetism. Although usually dated to 1880, the formula was first established in 1869 by L. V. Lorenz (optics) and subsequently in 1878 by H. A. Lorentz (electromagnetism). Apart from discussing the origin and priority of the Lorenz-Lorentz formula the paper outlines its early use in molecular physics and physical chemistry. During the late nineteenth century studies of molecular refractivity based on the formula proved important in a number of ways. For example, they led to estimates of the size of molecules and provided information about the structure of chemical compounds.},

	abstract = {The densities along the orthobaric liquid curve of the following liquefied gases have been measured with a precision of a few parts in 104: argon (86 to 118 K); krypton (118 to 164 K); xenon (164 to 219 K); oxygen (80 to 121 K); nitrogen (78 to 105 K); carbon monoxide (78 to 111 K); methane (92 to 151 K); carbon tetrafluoride (91 to 185 K). The measurements were made on a sample of about 9 cm3 in a glass pyknometer, which was incorporated in a cryostat assembly similar to that used in conventional lowtemperature adiabatic calorimetry. The results have been considered from the point of view of the law of corresponding states. When the volume is plotted as a fraction of the critical volume Vc against temperature expressed as a fraction of the critical temperature Tc, the results for liquid krypton, xenon, and nitrogen conform to a common curve. By changing the “best” values of Vc for argon and oxygen by about 0.5 per cent (which is probably within the uncertainty limits of these values of Vc), the points for these two liquids could also be made to fall on the same curve. But there are indications of small divergences from this curve for methane and carbon monoxide, even if the values of Vc adopted for these two substances are altered. Over the temperature ranges studied, the so-called rectilinear diameter for all eight substances examined is in fact a very slight curve, but extrapolation to the critical temperature of a least-squares straight line gives values of the critical volume within about one per cent of the literature values.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) optimization of steady-state vapor-compression cycle (VCC) operation. Five degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the VCC are optimized using an objective function which minimizes the rate of exergy destruction in the cycle. The use of exergy is motivated by its ability to capture the physics of both the first and second laws of thermodynamics in a single property. A case study is considered in which the optimization is applied to a commercial truck transport refrigeration system (TTRS). The results suggest that by using the optimal set points generated by the exergy-based objective function, an increase of 52.5\% in COP can be achieved over nominal operation. In particular, the optimization results highlight the regulation of evaporator and condenser pressure as critical parameters in improving the efficiency of steady-state cycle operation.},

	abstract = {Sparkgap are most widely used closing switches in various high-voltage pulsed power systems and its reliable operation at desired voltage level is very essential. Conventionally by adjusting the filling gas pressure inside sparkgap switch, breakdown voltage level is altered but switching characteristics such as stability in hold-off voltage at various pressures, breakdown delay, plasma channel formation, and erosion rate are mainly dictated by adopted electrode profile and its dimensions, inter-electrode gap length and polarity. In this paper, experimental results obtained on breakdown characteristics of four different electrode geometries\&mdash;Plane Parallel, Hemi-spherical, Bruce, and Rogowski and also a generalized criterion for fixing major dimensions of electrode and inter-gap length to ensure uniform electric field in the inter-electrode region are reported. All electrodes are of brass material and have common radius and thickness of 25 mm and 18 mm, respectively (surface finish \&lt;1 \&micro;m). Experiments performed on various electrode profiles in gap lengths of 2 mm to 5 mm range with pure nitrogen (N2) gas pressurization up to 50 psi reveal that among all profiles, Rogowski performs most reliably having stable hold-off voltage in wide operating range. Hold-off voltage magnitude and breakdown delay was commonly obtained higher for negative polarity in all trials. A comprehensive overview of experimental investigation reported herein compares suitability of various electrode profiles and polarity for reliable switching.},

	title = {Evaluation of the {Dielectric} {Capability} of {Ester} {Based} {Oils} for {Power} {Transformers}},
	abstract = {Mineral oil has been used as the liquid insulation of large power transformers for the past hundred years. A disadvantage to its use is that it can pollute the environment if spilt. As a result, there has been interest by the Utilities in using ester based transformer fluids, which are biodegradable and non-toxic. These are of two types, natural vegetable oils and synthetically produced oils which have similar characteristics. Ideally these oils
should be capable of operating in existing transformers designed to use mineral oil.

In order to use an ester oil in a large power transformer with confidence, the oil’s dielectric strength must be thoroughly investigated. The dielectric strength of the vegetable oil should be at least equal to that of the mineral oil to allow straight replacement. If the dielectric strength of ester oil is less than that of the mineral oil, it will be for the transformer manufacturer to determine whether modifications to the design are required. Oil manufacturers publish the mean dielectric strength of their product; however, this is simplistic because the mean does not indicate the lowest voltage at which the oil will fail. Furthermore there is no indication of how the working conditions of the oil inside the transformer affect its dielectric strength.

The breakdown of an oil is caused by some weak link, for instance particles. It is therefore necessary to understand how the conditions representative of a transformer, such as water and temperature, affect the impact of these weak links on the dielectric strength of the oil.

The work presented in this thesis studies the AC and lightning breakdown voltages of two esters, one natural \& one synthetic, under a variety of conditions and compares to those of mineral oil. The AC breakdown voltages of these oils when new are presented using electrode gaps of 1mm, 5mm and 10mm. A detailed comparison of their dielectric strengths is made based on a sample of one hundred AC breakdown voltages for an electrode gap of 1mm. The effects of water, temperature and oxidation on the breakdown voltages of the oil are then analysed.

In general this project has found that the AC breakdown voltages, using 1mm electrode gap, of esters are higher than those of the mineral oil. However, the lightning impulse breakdown voltages of esters are between 10\% and 20\% lower. Further work is required to analyse the dielectric strengths of esters at electrode gaps larger than 1mm. It is concluded that esters could be suitable replacements for mineral oil in large power transformers, but further research is required to arrive at a definite conclusion.},

However, when using this confidence interval, the actual coverage probability often falls under the nominal coverage probability in small cases. On the other hand, several confidence intervals where the actual cover age probability does not fall under the nominal coverage probability are suggested. In this study, we intro-duce five exact confidence intervals where the actual coverage probability does not fall under the nominal coverage probability and we calculate the expected length of the confidence intervals and compare/verify the accuracy of the coverage probabilities. Further, we examined the characteristics of these five exact confidence intervals at length. Coverage probability of Sterne was significantly closer to 0.95 than the other confidence intervals and stable. Its expected Length are not scattered in the width compared with the other methods. As a result, we found that the quality of the confidence interval based on the Sterne test is its availability for small samples.},

Based on measuring the surface potential decaying curve of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) block charged by a needle-plane corona discharge, its surface trapping parameters are calculated with the isothermal current theory, and the correlative curve between the surface trap density and its energy level is obtained. The maximum density of electron traps and hole traps in the surface layer of PTFE presents a similar value of ∼2.7×1017eV−1m−3, and the energy level of its electron and hole traps is of about 0.85–1.0eV and 0.80–0.90eV, respectively. Via the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique, the F, C, K and O elements are detected on the surface of PTFE samples, and F shows a remarkable atom proportion of ∼73.3\%, quite different from the intrinsic distribution corresponding to its chemical formula. The electron traps are attributed to quantities of F atoms existing on the surface of PTFE due to its molecular chain with C atoms surrounded by F atoms spirally. It is considered that the distortions of chemical and electronic structure on solid surface are responsible for the flashover phenomena occurring at a low applied voltage.},

	abstract = {This work details the development of a three-dimensional (3D) electric field model for the LUX detector. The detector took data during two periods of searching for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) searches. After the first period completed, a time-varying non-uniform negative charge developed in the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) panels that define the radial boundary of the detector's active volume. This caused electric field variations in the detector in time, depth and azimuth, generating an electrostatic radially-inward force on electrons on their way upward to the liquid surface. To map this behavior, 3D electric field maps of the detector's active volume were built on a monthly basis. This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL Multiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected on a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the course of the exposure from -3.6 to \$-5.5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$C/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$. From our studies, we deduce that the electric field magnitude varied while the mean value of the field of \${\textbackslash}sim200\${\textasciitilde}V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure. As a result of this work the varying electric fields and their impact on event reconstruction and discrimination were successfully modeled.},

Decaying Kr-83m nuclei were detected through liquid xenon scintillation. Conversion electrons with energies of 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV from the decay of Kr-83m were both observed. This calibration source will allow the characterization of the scintillation and ionization response of noble liquid detectors at low energies, highly valuable for the search for WIMP dark matter. Kr-83m may also be useful for measuring fluid flow dynamics, both to understand purification in noble liquid-based particle detectors, as well as for studies of classical and quantum turbulence in superfluid helium.},

At an electric field of 0.5 kV/cm, the measured drift velocities and corresponding temperature coefficients respectively are 1.97±0.04mm∕μs and (−0.69±0.05)\%/K for liquid xenon, and 1.42±0.03mm∕μs and (+0.11±0.01)\%/K for gaseous xenon at 1.5 bar. In addition, we measure longitudinal diffusion coefficients of 25.7±4.6 cm2/s and 149±23 cm2/s, for liquid and gas, respectively. The quantum efficiency of the gold photocathode is studied at the photon energy of 4.73 eV in liquid and gaseous xenon, and vacuum.

The goal of this technique is to reduce the background event rate by discriminating edge events from bulk events. Analyses of dark matter search data which employ it would benefit from increased longitudinal electron diffusion. We show that a significant increase is expected if the applied electric field is decreased. This observation is trivial to implement but runs contrary to conventional wisdom and practice. We also extract a first measurement of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient, and confirm the expectation that electron diffusion in liquid xenon is highly anisotropic under typical operating conditions.},

The diffusion of charge carriers will directly affect the spatial resolution of LXe ionization signal.

In pure xenon we find excellent agreement with world data at all E/P, for both drift velocity and diffusion coefficients. However, a larger value of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient than theoretical predictions is found at low E/P in pure xenon, below the range of reduced fields usually probed by TPC experiments. A similar effect is observed in xenon-helium gas mixtures at somewhat larger E/P. Drift velocities in xenon-helium mixtures are found to be theoretically well predicted. Although longitudinal diffusion in xenon-helium mixtures is found to be larger than anticipated, extrapolation based on the measured longitudinal diffusion coefficients suggest that the use of helium additives to reduce transverse diffusion in xenon gas remains a promising prospect.},

	abstract = {A dedicated test of the effects of Nitrogen contamination in liquid Argon has been performed at the INFN-Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS, Italy) within the WArP R\&D program. A detector has been designed and assembled for this specific task and connected to a system for the injection of controlled amounts of gaseous Nitrogen into the liquid Argon. Purpose of the test is to detect the reduction of the Ar scintillation light emission as a function of the amount of the Nitrogen contaminant injected in the Argon volume. A wide concentration range, spanning from about 10{\textasciicircum}-1 ppm up to about 10{\textasciicircum}3 ppm, has been explored. Measurements have been done with electrons in the energy range of minimum ionizing particles (gamma-conversion from radioactive sources). Source spectra at different Nitrogen contaminations are analyzed, showing sensitive reduction of the scintillation yield at increasing concentrations. The rate constant of the light quenching process induced by Nitrogen in liquid Ar has been found to be k(N2)=0.11 micros{\textasciicircum}-1 ppm{\textasciicircum}-1. Direct PMT signals acquisition at high time resolution by fast Waveform recording allowed to extract with high precision the main characteristics of the scintillation light emission in pure and contaminated LAr. In particular, the decreasing behavior in lifetime and relative amplitude of the slow component is found to be appreciable from O(1 ppm) of Nitrogen concentrations.},

	abstract = {A dedicated test of the effects of Oxygen contamination in liquid Argon has been performed at the INFN-Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS, Italy) within the WArP R\&D program. Two detectors have been used: the WArP2.3 lt prototype and a small (0.7 lt) dedicated detector, coupled with a system for the injection of controlled amounts of gaseous Oxygen. O2 contamination in LAr leads to depletion of both the free electron charge (via attachment process) and the scintillation light (via quenching and absorption mechanisms) available for ionization signal detection. Purpose of the test with the 0.7 lt detector was to detect the reduction of the long-lived component lifetime of the Argon scintillation light emission and of the overall light yield at increasing O2 concentration. Data from the WArP prototype were used for determining the behavior of both the ionization electron lifetime and the scintillation long-lived component lifetime at decreasing O2 concentration by the purification process activated in closed loop during the acquisition run. The electron lifetime measurements allowed to infer the O2 content of the Argon and correlate it with the long-lived scintillation lifetime data. The effects of Oxygen contamination on the scintillation light have been thus extensively measured over a wide range of O2 concentration, spanning from ∼ 10−3 ppm up to ∼ 10 ppm.},

An exact solution for the electrostatic field between a metallic hemi-ellipsoidal needle on a plate (as a cathode) and a flat anode are presented. The basic idea is to replace the cathode by a linearly charged thread in a uniform electric field and to use a set of “image” charges to reproduce the anode. Exact analytical formulas of the electrical field, field enhancement factor, and electrostatic force are found. Using the Fowler-Nordheim theory we obtain an exact analytical formula for the total current. The field enhancement factor, total force and emission current, as well as their distributions on the top of the needle for a wide range of parameters, have been calculated and analyzed.},

	abstract = {Aluminum, oxidized electrolytically, and subsequently treated with caesium and oxygen possesses new and interesting properties when subjected to electron bombardment in the presence of an adjacent collector electrode whose potential is held positive with respect to the aluminum. True secondary electron emission from the treated surface results in the establishment of a positive charge on the surface and a polarization of the oxide film. This positive charge acting through the thin oxide film produces a high gradient, resulting in the emission of electrons through the surface. The emission increases with collector voltage and beam currents, obeying power laws, but exhibits saturation tendencies. The removal of the primary beam does not result in the immediate cessation of the field emission, but rather in a slow decay which is due to the fact that the surface charge takes an appreciable time to leak away. Similar time lags are noticed when the beam is first applied, particularly if the collector voltage has been reversed while the beam impinges on the surface. The surfaces are also light sensitive, in that light causes a decrease in the field emission and a speeding up of decay. Attempts were made to demonstrate this effect for other surfaces, but, with a few exceptions, the results were negative.},

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that over 80\% of matter in the universe is dark matter – which is non-baryonic in nature and is thought to be composed of a new, slow-moving, stable particle not found in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Its presence is inferred from gravitational effects on luminous matter from several independent observations, from the galactic to the cosmological scale. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the leading candidate, which can explain all of the observed effects. LUX and LZ are dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPC), aiming to observe scattering of WIMPs from xenon nuclei. LUX has an active mass of 250 kg of liquid xenon, and took data at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, between 2013 and 2016. The first WIMP search run of 85 live days in 2013 set world-leading exclusion limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section. This was improved by a reanalysis of those data, and subsequently by a new run yielding 332 live days, which set a minimum exclusion limit of 2.2 × 10−46 cm2 for a 50 GeV WIMP (90\% CL). In addition, the most stringent limit to date on the spindependent WIMP-neutron scattering cross section comes from the reanalysis of the 2013 dataset, with a minimum exclusion of 9.4 × 10−41 cm2 for a 33 GeV WIMP. LZ is a next generation experiment with a 7 tonne active mass to be deployed in the same location as LUX, expected to be 100 times more sensitive. Work presented in this thesis includes analysis of the 2013 LUX search data to produce the spin-dependent results, evaluating the detector response using a tritium β− source, and determining the 85Kr background from data. A study was carried out on spurious electron emission phenomena from thin cathodic wires under high electric fields, using LUX engineering data where the grid voltages were increased above nominal operating values; this led to new insights into the microscopic breakdown mechanisms which have affected these (and other) TPC detectors for decades. The detailed understanding of the electroluminescence response gained in LUX was applied to the design of the LZ electroluminescence region; detailed simulation work of electrode geometry was performed to assess the performance of several candidate designs.},

It is regarded that the electrical breakdown in vacuum is initiated by particles generated on the electrode surface. This article refers to breakdown mechanisms of vacuum gaps on the basis of particle generation on the electrode surface. Firstly, difference of the breakdown mechanism in gas and vacuum is explained. Secondly the outline of field electron emission based breakdown mechanism, namely anode initiated breakdown and cathode initiated breakdown, is given. Then the microparticle based mechanism, so called clump theory, is explained. In addition several experiments to improve hold-off voltage of vacuum gap are described.},

We observe strong charge-to-light discrimination enhancement with increased event energy. For events with S1=120 detected photons, i.e., equivalent to a nuclear recoil energy of ∼100 keV, we observe an electronic recoil background acceptance of {\textless}10−5 at a nuclear recoil signal acceptance of 50\%. We also observe modest electric field dependence of the discrimination power, which peaks at a field of around 300 V/cm over the range of fields explored in this study (50–500 V/cm). In the weakly interacting massive particle search region of S1=1−80 phd, the minimum electronic recoil leakage we observe is (7.3±0.6)×10−4, which is obtained for a drift field of 240–290 V/cm. Pulse shape discrimination is utilized to improve our results, and we find that, at low energies and low fields, there is an additional reduction in background leakage by a factor of up to 3. We develop an empirical model for recombination fluctuations which, when used alongside the Noble Element Scintillation Technique simulation package, correctly reproduces the skewness of the electronic recoil data. We use this updated simulation to study the width of the electronic recoil band, finding that its dominant contribution comes from electron-ion recombination fluctuations, followed in magnitude of contribution by fluctuations in the S1 signal, fluctuations in the S2 signal, and fluctuations in the total number of quanta produced for a given energy deposition.},

	abstract = {The region around the Galactic center (GC) is now well established to be brighter at energies of a few GeV than expected from conventional models of diffuse gamma-ray emission and catalogs of known gamma-ray sources. We study the GeV excess using 6.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We characterize the uncertainty of the GC excess spectrum and morphology due to uncertainties in cosmic-ray source distributions and propagation, uncertainties in the distribution of interstellar gas in the Milky Way, and uncertainties due to a potential contribution from the Fermi bubbles. We also evaluate uncertainties in the excess properties due to resolved point sources of gamma rays. The Galactic center is of particular interest as it would be expected to have the brightest signal from annihilation of weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. However, control regions along the Galactic plane, where a dark-matter signal is not expected, show excesses of similar amplitude relative to the local background. Based on the magnitude of the systematic uncertainties, we conservatively report upper limits for the annihilation cross section as function of particle mass and annihilation channel.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of liquid argon time projection chamber detectors makes the characterization of the dielectric properties of liquid argon a critical task. To improve understanding of these properties, a systematic study of the breakdown electric field in liquid argon was conducted using a dedicated cryostat connected to the MicroBooNE cryogenic system at Fermilab. An electrode sphere-plate geometry was implemented using spheres with diameters of 1.3 mm, 5.0 mm, and 76 mm. The MicroBooNE cryogenic system allowed measurements to be taken at a variety of electronegative contamination levels ranging from a few parts-per-million to tens of parts-per- trillion. The cathode-anode distance was varied from 0.1 mm to 2.5 cm. The results demonstrate a geometric dependence of the electric field strength at breakdown. This study is the first time that the dependence of the breakdown field on stressed cathode area has been shown for liquid argon.},

We consider ordinary nuclear recoils, excitation of collective modes (phonons), and electronic excitations, paying careful attention to the impact of the energy threshold of the experiment. Large exposure experiments with keV energy thresholds provide the best (future) limits when the Dark Matter is small enough to be treated as a point particle, but rapidly lose sensitivity for more extended dark bound states, or when the mediator is light. In those cases, low threshold, low exposure experiments (such as with a superfluid helium, polar material or superconducting target) are often more sensitive due to coherent enhancement over the dark nucleons. We also discuss indirect constraints on composite Asymmetric Dark Matter arising from self-interaction, formation history and the properties of the composite states themselves.},

Results from a dark matter search with XENON10 have been published elsewhere. In this paper, we summarize the design and performance of the detector and its subsystems, based on calibration data using sources of gamma-rays and neutrons as well as background and Monte Carlo simulations data. The results on the detector's energy threshold, energy and position resolution, and overall efficiency show a performance that exceeds design specifications, in view of the very low energy threshold achieved ({\textless}10 keVr) and the excellent energy resolution achieved by combining the ionization and scintillation signals, detected simultaneously.},

Starting with the recent release of the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST v2.0), electronic recoil data from the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decays of \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}3\$H and \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$C in the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector were used to tune the model, in addition to external data sets that allow for extrapolation beyond the LUX data-taking conditions. This paper also presents techniques used for modeling complicated temporal and spatial detector pathologies that can adversely affect data using a simplified model framework. The methods outlined in this report show an example of the robust applications possible with NEST v2.0, while also providing the final electronic recoil model and detector parameters that will used in the new analysis package, the LUX Legacy Analysis Monte Carlo Application (LLAMA), for accurate reproduction of the LUX data. As accurate background reproduction is crucial for the success of rare-event searches, such as dark matter direct detection experiments, the techniques outlined here can be used in other single-phase and dual-phase xenon detectors to assist with accurate ER background reproduction.},

Despite a moderate lead shielding and the high-background environment, the first sub-GeV spin-independent dark matter limit based on a germanium target has been achieved. The experiment provides the most stringent, nuclear recoil based, above-ground limit on spin-independent interactions above 600{\textasciitilde}MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$.

Finally, the dark matter search has also been extended to interactions via the Migdal effect, resulting for the first time in the exclusion of particles with masses between 45 and 150{\textasciitilde}MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ with spin-independent cross sections ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

We show that, for the first time, direct detection experiments are testing this DM production mechanism. This applies to scenarios where the SM and hidden sectors communicate through a light mediator particle of mass less than a few MeV. Through the exchange of such light mediator, the very same FIMP candidates can have self-interactions that are in the range required to address the small scale structure issues of collisionless cold dark matter.},

	abstract = {We measured breakdown voltage in liquid nitrogen (LN/sub 2/) with sphere to plane electrode and coaxial cylindrical electrode configurations, and discussed them with stressed electrode area (SEA) and/or stressed liquid volume (SLV). We also carried out statistical analysis of the results using Weibull distribution to examine the area and volume effects on breakdown voltage in LN/sub 2/. The dc and ac breakdown strength in LN/sub 2/ decreased to 1/4/spl sim/1/5 with increasing the SSEA (statistical stressed electrode area) and SSLV (statistical stressed liquid volume). These results permitted us to confirm that the area and volume effects definitely determined the dc and ac breakdown strength in LN/sub 2/. Next, Weibull shape parameter m for sphere to plane and coaxial cylindrical electrodes were estimated to be about 6/spl sim/8 and 11/spl sim/13, respectively. The results of the Weibull statistics were compared with the conventional concept of the SEA or SLV. Consequently, SSEA or SSLV was found to be nearly equal to 80/spl sim/85\% of SEA or SLV. This result indicates that at least 80/spl sim/85\% of the maximum electric field strength should be considered for the insulation design in LN/sub 2/ when the area and volume effects are involved.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

As with the conventional "thermal freeze-out" production mechanism, the relic abundance reflects a combination of initial thermal distributions together with particle masses and couplings that can be measured in the laboratory or astrophysically. The freeze-in yield is IR dominated by low temperatures near the FIMP mass and is independent of unknown UV physics, such as the reheat temperature after inflation. Moduli and modulinos of string theory compactifications that receive mass from weak-scale supersymmetry breaking provide implementations of the freeze-in mechanism, as do models that employ Dirac neutrino masses or GUT-scale-suppressed interactions. Experimental signals of freeze-in and FIMPs can be spectacular, including the production of new metastable coloured or charged particles at the LHC as well as the alteration of big bang nucleosynthesis.},

The two particle-physics model parameters are the WIMPzilla mass and the Higgs-WIMPzilla coupling. The two cosmological parameters are the reheating temperature and the expansion rate of the universe at the end of inflation. We delineate the regions of parameters space where either gravitational or thermal production is dominant, and within those regions we identify the parameters that predict the observed dark matter relic abundance.

Underground detectors like DEAP-3600, designed for the search of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, can actually be sensitive to these super-heavy dark matter candidates. The collaboration has performed a blind analysis of data from DEAP-3600 over 813 days of lifetime, by looking for a multi-scattering signal. As no event is found after the unblinding, leading exclusion limits are set, constraining dark matter in the mass range of (8.3 × 106 — 1.2 × 1019) GeV/c2, and dark matter-argon nucleus cross-sections in the range (1.0 × 10−23 — 2.4 × 10−18) cm2.},

Experimentalists, as well as theorists who reanalyze/reinterpret experimental data, have used a few different techniques over the past few decades. In this paper, we review techniques based on solely the primary scintillation channel, the ionization or secondary channel available at non-zero drift electric fields, and combined techniques that include a simple linear combination and weighted averages, with a brief discussion of the application of profile likelihood, maximum likelihood, and machine learning. Comparing results for electron recoils (beta and gamma interactions) and nuclear recoils (primarily from neutrons) from the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST) simulation to available data, we confirm that combining all available information generates higher-precision means, lower widths (energy resolution), and more symmetric shapes (approximately Gaussian) especially at keV-scale energies, with the symmetry even greater when thresholding is addressed. Near thresholds, bias from upward fluctuations matters. For MeV-GeV scales, if only one channel is utilized, an ionization-only-based energy scale outperforms scintillation; channel combination remains beneficial. We discuss here what major collaborations use.},

A global analysis is performed using measurements of electron and photon yields compiled from all available historical data, as well as measurements of the ratio of the two. These data sweep over energies from 1 - 300 keV and external applied electric fields from 0 - 4060 V/cm. The model is constrained by constructing global cost functions and using a gradient descent minimizer, a simulated annealing algorithm, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to optimize and find confidence intervals on all free parameters in the model. This analysis contrasts with previous work in that we do not unnecessarily exclude data sets nor impose artificially conservative assumptions, do not use spline functions, and reduce the number of parameters used in NEST v0.98. We report our results and the calculated best-fit charge and light yields. These quantities are crucial to understanding the response of liquid xenon detectors in the energy regime important for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.},

In a two phase time projection chamber, when simulating the pulse caused by electroluminescence light, the ionization electron mean free path in gas, the drift velocity, singlet and triplet decay times, diffusion constants, and the electron trapping time, have been implemented. This modeling has been incorporated into a complete software package, which realistically simulates the expected pulse shapes for these types of detectors.},

Using much more comprehensive data on the same clusters, we identify several substantial errors in their offset measurements. Correcting these errors relaxes the upper limit on sDM m to 2 cm2 g−1, following the Harvey et al. prescription for relating offsets to cross sections in a simple solid-body scattering model. Furthermore, many clusters in the sample violate the assumptions behind this prescription, so even this revised upper limit should be used with caution. Although this particular sample does not tightly constrain self-interacting DM models when analyzed this way, we discuss how merger ensembles may be used more effectively in the future. We conclude that errors inherent in using single-band imaging to identify mass and light peaks do not necessarily average out in a sample of this size, particularly when a handful of substructures constitute a majority of the weight in the ensemble.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

The observed large scale structure is likely to be due to gravitational growth of density fluctuations in the post-inflation era. The evolving cosmic web is governed by non-linear gravitational growth of the initially weak density fluctuations in the dark energy dominated cosmology. Non-linear structure formation, accretion and merging processes, star forming and AGN activity produce gas shocks in the WHIM. Shock waves are converting a fraction of the gravitation power to thermal and non-thermal emission of baryonic/leptonic matter. They provide the most likely way to power the luminous matter in the WHIM. The plasma shocks in the WHIM are expected to be collisionless. Collisionless shocks produce a highly non-equilibrium state with anisotropic temperatures and a large differences in ion and electron temperatures. We discuss the ion and electron heating by the collisionless shocks and then review the plasma processes responsible for the Coulomb equilibration and collisional ionisation equilibrium of oxygen ions in the WHIM. MHD-turbulence produced by the strong collisionless shocks could provide a sizeable non-thermal contribution to the observed Doppler parameter of the UV line spectra of the WHIM.},

	abstract = {Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is a simple and well-motivated scenario that could explain long-standing puzzles in structure formation on small scales. If the required self-interaction arises through a light mediator (with mass ∼ 10 MeV) in the dark sector, this new particle must be unstable to avoid overclosing the universe. The decay of the light mediator could happen due to a weak coupling of the hidden and visible sectors, providing new signatures for direct detection experiments. The SIDM nuclear recoil spectrum is more peaked towards low energies compared to the usual case of contact interactions, because the mediator mass is comparable to the momentum transfer of nuclear recoils. We show that the SIDM signal could be distinguished from that of DM particles with contact interactions by considering the time-average energy spectrum in experiments employing diﬀerent target materials, or the average and modulated spectra in a single experiment. Using current limits from LUX and SuperCDMS, we also derive strong bounds on the mixing parameter between hidden and visible sector.},

	abstract = {This work investigates the development of nanosecond pulsed discharges in water ignited with the application of both positive and negative polarity pulses to submerged pin-to-plane electrodes. Optical diagnostics are used to study two main aspects of these discharges: the initiation phase, and the development phase. Nanosecond pulses up to 24 kV with 4 ns rise time, 10 ns duration and 5 ns fall time are used to ignite discharges in a 1.5 mm gap between a copper plate and a tungsten needle with radius of curvature of 25 µm. Fast ICCD imaging is used to trace the discharge development over varying applied pulse amplitudes for both positively and negatively applied pulses to the pin electrode. The discharge is found to progress similar to that of discharges in long gaps—long sparks—in gases, both in structure and development. The more important initiation phase is investigated via schlieren transmission imaging. The region near the tip of the electrode is investigated for slightly under-breakdown conditions, and changes in the liquid's refractive index and density are observed over the duration of the applied pulse. An attempt to explain the results is made based on the electrostriction model of discharge initiation.},

In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result, direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO, SBC, SENSEI, SuperCDMS, and XENON collaborations, and these collaborations provided input to the recommendations laid out here. Wide-spread adoption of these recommendations will make it easier to compare and combine future dark matter results.},

	abstract = {Owing to its excellent scaling potential, low power consumption, high switching speed, and good retention, and endurance properties, Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is one of the prime candidates to supplant current Nonvolatile Memory (NVM) based on the floating gate (FG) MOSFET transistor, which is at the end of its scaling capability. The RRAM technology comprises two subcategories: 1) the resistive phase change memory (PCM), which has been very recently deployed commercially, and 2) the filamentary conductive bridge RAM (CBRAM) which holds the promise of even better scaling potential, less power consumption, and faster access times. This thesis focuses on several aspects of the CBRAM technology. CBRAM devices are based on nanoionic transport and chemo-physical reactions to create filamentary conductive paths across a dielectric sandwiched between two metal electrodes. These nano-size filaments can be formed and ruptured reliably and repeatedly by application of appropriate voltages. Although, there exists a large body of literature on this topic, many aspects of the CBRAM mechanisms and are still poorly understood. In the next paragraph, the aspects of CBRAM studied in this thesis are spelled out in more detail.},

	abstract = {Dielectric strength testing of ceramics can be performed with various setups and parameters. Comparisons of results from different sources are often not meaningful, because the results are strongly dependent on the actual testing procedure. The aim of this study is to quantify the influence of voltage ramp rate, electrode size, electrode conditioning, and sample thickness on the measured AC dielectric strength of a commercial alumina. Mean values, Weibull moduli, and failure probabilities determined in standardized short time tests are evaluated and related to withstand voltage tests. Dielectric strength values in the range from 21.6 to 33.2 kV∙mm–1 were obtained for the same material using different testing procedures. Short time tests resulted in small standard deviations ({\textless} 2 kV∙mm–1) and high Weibull moduli around 30, while withstand tests at voltage levels with low and virtual zero failure probability in short time tests resulted in large scatter of withstand time and Weibull moduli {\textless} 1. The strong decrease in Weibull moduli is attributed to progressive damage from partial discharge and depolarization during AC testing. These findings emphasize the necessity of a thorough documentation of testing procedure and highlight the importance of withstand voltage tests for a comprehensive material characterization.},

	abstract = {When a sufficient electric field is placed across a dielectric material, electrical breakdown occurs. The field strength at which this occurs is referred to as the dielectric strength or electrostatic discharge (ESD) voltage. The dielectric strength of thin (25 μm to 250 μm) film polymer samples (low density polyethylene, Teflon, Kapton, Mylar, and other fluorocarbon polymers) have been measured by placing them between parallel plate electrodes and increasing the voltage until breakdown occurs across the dielectric barrier creating a path for the flow of large discharge currents. The results are affected by the rate at which the applied potential is increased and the incremental increases. Rates between 20 V/s and 500 V/s and voltage increments between 10 V and 500 V have been studied. Larger rates cause a premature breakdown compared to a slower ramping speed. This may be due to a kind of conditioning of the sample; the stress of the high voltage is easier to handle if taken in small increases.},

	abstract = {The electric field enhancement due to an isolated saw-tooth asperity in an infinite channel is considered with the goal of providing some inputs to the choice of field enhancement factors used to describe microscale gas breakdown. The Schwarz–Christoffel transformation is used to map the interior of the channel to the upper half of the transformed plane. The expression for the electric field in the transformed plane is then used to determine the electric field distribution in the channel as well as field enhancement near the asperity. The effective field enhancement factor is determined and its dependence on operating and geometrical parameters is studied. While the effective field enhancement factor depends only weakly on the height of the asperity in comparison to the channel, it is influenced significantly by the base angles of the asperity. Due to the strong dependence of field emission current density on electric field, the effective field enhancement factor (βeff) is shown to vary rapidly with the applied electric field irrespective of the geometrical parameters. This variation is included in the analysis of microscale gas breakdown and compared with results obtained using a constant βeff as is done traditionally. Even though results for a varying βeff may be approximately reproduced using an equivalent constant βeff independent of E-field, it might be important for a range of operating conditions. This is confirmed by extracting βeff from experimental data for breakdown in argon microgaps with plane-parallel cathodes and comparing its dependence on the E-field. While the use of two-dimensional asperities is shown to be a minor disadvantage of the proposed approach in its current form, it can potentially help in developing predictive capabilities as opposed to treating βeff as a curve-fitting parameter.},

Gases characterized include argon, xenon, CO2, CF4, and mixtures 90-10 argon-CH4,90-10 argon-CO2and 99-1 argon-CF4. We develop a theoretical model for high voltage breakdown based on microphysical simulations that use PyBoltz electron swarm Monte Carlo results as input to Townsend- and Meek-like discharge criteria. This model is shown to be highly predictive at high pressure, out-performing traditional Paschen-Townsend and Meek-Raether models significantly. At lower pressure-times-distance, the Townsend-like model is an excellent description for noble gases whereas the Meek-like model provides a highly accurate prediction for insulating gases.},

Average values of the secondary emission coefficients are also estimated for brass and atomic and molecular ions as well as excited atoms and molecules of He and Xe, through a best fit of the simulated Paschen curves to the experimental ones.

Pour les valeurs élevées de \{E\}/\{p 0\} les gaz sont cités ci-dessus dans l'ordre inverse des valeurs de η. Le parcours moyen en fonction de l'énergie des électrons pour le crypton et le xénon étant semblable à celui pour l'argon, on a comparé les résultats obtenus pour les gaz rares lourds avec ceux obtenus pour l'argon. Cette comparaison permet de déterminer d'une façon approximative la proportion des probabilités d'ionisation et celle des probabilités d'excitation pour l'argon, le crypton et le xénon. Pour une cathode de cuivre on a déterminé en fonction de \{E\}/\{p 0\} le nombre γ ni des électrons supplémentaires issus de la cathode pendant le temps requis pour la formation d'un nombre ni d'ions positifs dans le gaz. La forme générale des fonctions donnant γ permet de diviser les γ ni électrons supplémentaires en deux parties. L'une contient les électrons libérés de la cathode par suite des chocs des ions positifs et l'autre contient les électrons libérés par l'effet photo-électrique de la radiation extrêmement ultra-violette du gaz.

We introduce a dark matter candidate which realizes this maximum cross section: HighlY interactive ParticlE Relics (HYPERs). After HYPERs freeze-in, a dark sector phase transition decreases the mass of the mediator which connects HYPERs to the visible sector. This increases the HYPER's direct detection cross section, but in such a way as to leave the HYPER's abundance unaffected and avoid conflict with measurements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. HYPERs present a benchmark for direct detection experiments in a parameter space with few known dark matter models.},

For this purpose, we used a set-up with cylindrical electrodes embedded out-of-axis in a cylindrical epoxy rod. Experiments were performed in N2, SF6, ambient air, Ar and CO2. The discharge inception voltage was measured, from which the critical value K of the ionization integral was reconstructed assuming a non-disturbed Laplacian field distribution. We have validated that for electropositive gases Ar an N2 the generally assumed value of K = 10 is in good agreement with our measurements. For electronegative gases, however, the experimentally obtained values turned out to be considerably higher. We attribute this discrepancy mainly to the statistical time delay of the first electron; to increase the probability of discharge inception in a critical region, it was necessary to extend the critical area by means of applying an overvoltage to the system.},

The mobility of the TMSi/sup +/ ion is more than one order of magnitude lower than the intrinsic mobility of positive charge carriers (holes) in very pure liquid xenon. The positive ionic mobility is influenced by electrostrictive effects, which lead to the formation of solid layers of Xe atoms around the ion, and to a locally enhanced viscosity. A simple model for the cluster formation is discussed. Qualitative agreement is obtained over most of the temperature range, but serious deviations occur at the triple point. Another shortcoming of the model is the fact that it cannot explain the higher mobility of the negative oxygen ions.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The energy spectra of the proportional scintillation for 207Bi were compared with those of the charge. The best resolution of the proportional scintillation was about 18\% fwhm for 1 MeV electrons, which was almost the same as that of the charge.

The interpretation is given on this basis of electric strength measurements for high-density supercritical vapors.},

	abstract = {The impulse dielectric behavior of insulating liquids is of significant interest for researchers and engineers working in the field of design, construction, and operation of pulsed power systems. Analysis of the literature data on transformer oils shows that potentially there are several different physical processes that could be responsible for dielectric breakdown by submicrosecond and microsecond impulses. While for short submicrosecond impulses ionization (plasma streamer) is likely to be the main breakdown mechanism, for longer impulses, the thermal effects associated with Joule heating start to play an important role. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the latter mechanism in dielectric liquids of different degrees of purity stressed with high-voltage (HV) impulses with duration sufficient to cause local heating, evaporation, and formation of prebreakdown gas bubbles. The proposed model is based on the assumption that dielectric breakdown is developed through percolation channels of gas bubbles, and the criterion of formation of these percolation chains is obtained. To test the developed model, the breakdown field-time characteristics have been calculated for the liquid with chemical composition close to that of transformer oils but with known thermodynamic characteristics (n-hexane). Its dielectric strength has been obtained as a function of externally applied pressure and temperature. The analytical results show good agreement when compared with the experimental data available in the literature.},

These particles could leave track-like signatures in current experiments, similar to lightly-ionizing particles. We show that previously calculated limits from the MAJORANA Demonstrator on the flux of lightly-ionizing particles can be used to exclude MIMP dark matter parameter space up to a mass of 10{\textasciicircum}15 GeV/c{\textasciicircum}2. We also calculate limits from the standard XENON1T analysis in this high-mass regime, properly taking into account flux limitations and multi-scatter effects. Finally, we show that a dedicated MIMP analysis using the XENON1T dark matter search could probe unexplored parameter space up to masses of 10{\textasciicircum}18 GeV/c{\textasciicircum}2.},

	abstract = {Critical probes of dark matter come from tests of its elastic scattering with nuclei. The results are typically assumed to be model-independent, meaning that the form of the potential need not be specified and that the cross sections on different nuclear targets can be simply related to the cross section on nucleons. For point-like spin-independent scattering, the assumed scaling relation is \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi A\} {\textbackslash}propto A{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}mu\_A{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi N\}{\textbackslash}propto A{\textasciicircum}4 {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi N\}\$, where the \$A{\textasciicircum}2\$ comes from coherence and the \${\textbackslash}mu\_A{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}simeq A{\textasciicircum}2 m\_N{\textasciicircum}2\$ from kinematics for \$m\_{\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}gg m\_A\$. Here we calculate where model independence ends, i.e., where the cross section becomes so large that it violates its defining assumptions. We show that the assumed scaling relations generically fail for dark matter-nucleus cross sections \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi A\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-32\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{-27\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}text\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, significantly below the geometric sizes of nuclei, and well within the regime probed by underground detectors. Last, we show on theoretical grounds, and in light of existing limits on light mediators, that point-like dark matter cannot have \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi N\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}\{-25\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}text\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, above which many claimed constraints originate from cosmology and astrophysics. The most viable way to have such large cross sections is composite dark matter, which introduces significant additional model dependence through the choice of form factor. All prior limits on dark matter with cross sections \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}chi N\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{-32\}{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}text\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ with \$m\_{\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}gtrsim 1{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}text\{GeV\}\$ must therefore be re-evaluated and reinterpreted.},

While this is not a completely new approach, with our work we want to highlight the importance of appropriate measurement set-up and contribute to a better understanding and analysis of dielectric breakdown. The measurement of breakdown tests is generally anything but trivial and the comparison of breakdown results for different set-ups is difficult, especially because not all scientific articles go into detail on the measurement method and all the important parameters, which can influence the breakdown event. For the results shown in this work we mainly used glass as a suitable model material and two different electrode setups at eleven different voltage ramps in the range of 5 V/s to 10,000 V/s. We found that there is a clear dependence of the dielectric breakdown strength on the voltage ramp and the electrode configuration as well as it should be distinguished between breakdowns which initiated at electrode edge and those initiated within the electrode area. There is almost no scatter for breakdown strengths which were initiated inside a silver paste electrode in comparison to breakdown strength from the electrode edges.},

We also identify a new effect which substantially enhances experimental sensitivity to large dark matter scattering cross-sections: while passing through atmospheric or solid overburden, there is a maximum number of scatters that dark matter undergoes, determined by the total number of scattering sites it passes, such as nuclei and electrons.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08979},
	abstract = {The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a mystery since it has so far eluded detection in the laboratory. To that end, the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment was built to directly observe the interaction of DM with xenon target nuclei. LUX acquired data from April 2013 to May 2016 at SURF in South Dakota, which led to publications of many world-leading exclusion limits that probe much of the unexplored DM parameter space. This manuscript describes two novel direct detection methods that used the first LUX dataset to place limits on sub-GeV DM. The Bremsstrahlung and Migdal effects consider electron recoils that accompany the standard DM-nucleus scattering, thereby extending the reach of the LUX detector to lower DM masses. The spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering was constrained for four different classes of mediators for DM particles with masses of 0.4-5 GeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. The detector conditions changed significantly before its final 332 live-days of data acquisition. The electric fields varied in a non-trivial non-symmetric manner, which triggered a need for a fully 3D model of the electric fields inside the LUX detector. The successful modeling of these electric fields, described herein, enabled a thorough understanding of the detector throughout its scientific program and strengthened its sensitivity to DM. The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is a next-generation xenon detector soon to start searching for DM. However, increasingly large noble liquid detectors like LZ are facing challenges with applications of high voltage (HV). The Xenon Breakdown Apparatus (XeBrA) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was built to characterize the HV behavior of liquid xenon and liquid argon. Results from XeBrA will serve not only to improve our understanding of the physical processes involved in the breakdown but also to inform the future of noble liquid detector engineering.},

Materials are considered to be imperfect heterogeneous continua composed of discrete volume elements whose characteristics are related to material structure and imperfections. The strength of the elements is assumed to be a statistic a quantity, and as the material is loaded elements fracture randomly throughout the body causing localized stress concentrations. The accumulation of these breaks results in overall failure. By relating strength to material structure this theory attempts to bridge the gap between the microscopic and continuum approaches to fracture mechanics. The theory is applied to composite materials reinforced with whiskers and continuous fibers. Comparisons with experimental data show good agreement. Results for whisker-reinforced composites appear to provide a good prediction of strength and an explanation of the disparity between the strength of individual whiskers and the strength of the composites made from them.},

              h
              tends to zero.
            
            
              The appropriate limiting distribution in any case may be found from the manner in which the probability of exceeding any value
              x
              tends to zero as
              x
              is increased. For the normal distribution the limiting distribution has
              h
              = 0.
            
            
              From the normal distribution the limiting distribution is approached with extreme slowness; the final series of forms passed through as the ultimate form is approached may be represented by the series of limiting distributions in which
              h
              tends to zero in a definite manner as
              n
              increases to infinity.
            
            Numerical values are given for the comparison of the actual with the penultimate distributions for samples of 60 to 1000, and of the penultimate with the ultimate distributions for larger samples.},

In liquid N2 (liq.N2), the breakdown voltage increases with pressure, but much less in nsec range. The polarity effect of breakdown in liq.N2, reverses with pulse width, pressure and electrode distance. Bubble process plays an important role in long time range and under low pressure, but positive streamer plays predominant role in short time range and under high pressure. In liquid He (liq.He), material and surface condition of cathode metal influence strongly on breakdown but that of anode influences little. Breakdown characteristics in superfluid and supercritical states are also studied. Breakdown characteristics of liquid Ne (liq.Ne) is similar to those of liq.He. Impurities also influence breakdown of cryogenic liquids.},

The distribution of the breakdown field is obtained for temperatures between 1.7 K and 4.0 K, pressures between the saturated vapor pressure and 626 Torr, and with electrodes of different surface polishes. A data-based approach for determining the electrode-surface-area scaling of the breakdown field is presented. The dependence of the breakdown probability on the field strength as extracted from the breakdown field distribution data is used to show that breakdown is a surface phenomenon closely correlated with Fowler-Nordheim field emission from asperities on the cathode. We show that the results from this analysis provides an explanation for the supposed electrode gap-size effect and also allows for a determination of the breakdown-field distribution for arbitrary shaped electrodes. Most importantly, the analysis method presented in this work can be extended to other noble liquids to explore the dependencies for electrical breakdown in those media.},

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field of several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which is nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The electrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet the design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and electrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct application of the necessary voltages from an external source to the experimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the liquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid for large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device consists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter liquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal state liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor pressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with leakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20\% of the maximum tolerable in the EDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated radiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of at least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM experiment, about 60\% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by the low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath.},

We find gas clouds are also sensitive to very large composite dark matter that interacts with nuclei through a fixed contact interaction cross-section. We also study the contact interaction model and implement multiscatter and overburden analyses to obtain bounds from experiments like CDMS, CRESST, DAMA, XQC, and XENON1T.},

	abstract = {Neutrinos, being the only fermions in the Standard Model of Particle Physics that do not possess electromagnetic or color charges, have the unique opportunity to communicate with fermions outside the Standard Model through mass mixing. Such Standard Model-singlet fermions are generally referred to as "sterile neutrinos''. In this review article, we discuss the theoretical and experimental motivation for sterile neutrinos, as well as their phenomenological consequences. With the benefit of hindsight in 2020, we point out potentially viable and interesting ideas. We focus in particular on sterile neutrinos that are light enough to participate in neutrino oscillations, but we also comment on the benefits of introducing heavier sterile states. We discuss the phenomenology of eV-scale sterile neutrinos in terrestrial experiments and in cosmology, we survey the global data, and we highlight various intriguing anomalies. We also expose the severe tension that exists between different data sets and prevents a consistent interpretation of the global data in at least the simplest sterile neutrino models. We discuss non-minimal scenarios that may alleviate some of this tension. We briefly review the status of keV-scale sterile neutrinos as dark matter and the possibility of explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe through leptogenesis driven by yet heavier sterile neutrinos.},
