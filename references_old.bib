	abstract = {The Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) is thought to contribute about 40-50 \% to the baryonic budget at the present evolution stage of the universe. The observed large scale structure is likely to be due to gravitational growth of density fluctuations in the post-inflation era. The evolving cosmic web is governed by non-linear gravitational growth of the initially weak density fluctuations in the dark energy dominated cosmology. Non-linear structure formation, accretion and merging processes, star forming and AGN activity produce gas shocks in the WHIM. Shock waves are converting a fraction of the gravitation power to thermal and non-thermal emission of baryonic/leptonic matter. They provide the most likely way to power the luminous matter in the WHIM. The plasma shocks in the WHIM are expected to be collisionless. Collisionless shocks produce a highly non-equilibrium state with anisotropic temperatures and a large differences in ion and electron temperatures. We discuss the ion and electron heating by the collisionless shocks and then review the plasma processes responsible for the Coulomb equilibration and collisional ionisation equilibrium of oxygen ions in the WHIM. MHD-turbulence produced by the strong collisionless shocks could provide a sizeable non-thermal contribution to the observed Doppler parameter of the UV line spectra of the WHIM.},

Zwicky's conclusion is based on the velocity dispersion of only seven galaxies in the Coma cluster of galaxies. Now, 84 years later, with 1000+ radial velocities measured for Coma cluster members, Coma's velocity dispersion is very close to that found by Zwicky.

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

An emphasis is laid on two-phase time projection chambers, but the models presented are also applicable to single phase detectors. In order to simulate the pulse shape due to primary scintillation light, the effects of the ratio of singlet and triplet dimer state populations, as well as their corresponding decay times, and the recombination time are incorporated into the model. In a two phase time projection chamber, when simulating the pulse caused by electroluminescence light, the ionization electron mean free path in gas, the drift velocity, singlet and triplet decay times, diffusion constants, and the electron trapping time, have been implemented. This modeling has been incorporated into a complete software package, which realistically simulates the expected pulse shapes for these types of detectors.},

The energy deposits were measured using a neutron-transmutation-doped Ge thermal sensor with a 17.7{\textasciitilde}eV (RMS) baseline heat energy resolution leading to a 60{\textasciitilde}eV analysis energy threshold. Despite a moderate lead shielding and the high-background environment, the first sub-GeV spin-independent dark matter limit based on a germanium target has been achieved. The experiment provides the most stringent, nuclear recoil based, above-ground limit on spin-independent interactions above 600{\textasciitilde}MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. The experiment also provides the most stringent limits on spin-dependent interactions with protons and neutrons below 1.3{\textasciitilde}GeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. Furthermore, the dark matter search results were studied in the context of Strongly Interacting Massive Particles, taking into account Earth-shielding effects, for which new regions of the available parameter space have been excluded. Finally, the dark matter search has also been extended to interactions via the Migdal effect, resulting for the first time in the exclusion of particles with masses between 45 and 150{\textasciitilde}MeV/c\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ with spin-independent cross sections ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.},

Results from a dark matter search with XENON10 have been published elsewhere. In this paper, we summarize the design and performance of the detector and its subsystems, based on calibration data using sources of gamma-rays and neutrons as well as background and Monte Carlo simulations data. The results on the detector's energy threshold, energy and position resolution, and overall efficiency show a performance that exceeds design specifications, in view of the very low energy threshold achieved ({\textless}10 keVr) and the excellent energy resolution achieved by combining the ionization and scintillation signals, detected simultaneously.},

Starting with the recent release of the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST v2.0), electronic recoil data from the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decays of \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}3\$H and \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$C in the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector were used to tune the model, in addition to external data sets that allow for extrapolation beyond the LUX data-taking conditions. This paper also presents techniques used for modeling complicated temporal and spatial detector pathologies that can adversely affect data using a simplified model framework. The methods outlined in this report show an example of the robust applications possible with NEST v2.0, while also providing the final electronic recoil model and detector parameters that will used in the new analysis package, the LUX Legacy Analysis Monte Carlo Application (LLAMA), for accurate reproduction of the LUX data. As accurate background reproduction is crucial for the success of rare-event searches, such as dark matter direct detection experiments, the techniques outlined here can be used in other single-phase and dual-phase xenon detectors to assist with accurate ER background reproduction.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 Ã— 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2â€“4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

Since the masses of the nonthermal WIMPS are in the range 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} to 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\} GeV, much larger than the mass of thermal wimpy WIMPS, they may be referred to as WIMPZILLAS.

We show that, for the first time, direct detection experiments are testing this DM production mechanism. This applies to scenarios where the SM and hidden sectors communicate through a light mediator particle of mass less than a few MeV. Through the exchange of such light mediator, the very same FIMP candidates can have self-interactions that are in the range required to address the small scale structure issues of collisionless cold dark matter.},

	abstract = {The statistical properties of least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data are examined. It is shown that, in the least-squares spectrum of gaussian noise, the reduction in the sum of squares at a particular frequency is aX22variable. The reductions at different frequencies are not independent, as there is a correlation between the height of the spectrum at any two frequencies,f1 andf2, which is equal to the mean height of the spectrum due to a sinusoidal signal of frequencyf1, at the frequencyf2. These correlations reduce the distortion in the spectrum of a signal affected by noise. Some numerical illustrations of the properties of least-squares frequency spectra are also given.},

	abstract = {The WIMPzilla hypothesis is that the dark matter is a super-weakly-interacting and super-heavy particle. Conventionally, the WIMPzilla abundance is set by gravitational particle production during or at the end of inflation. In this study we allow the WIMPzilla to interact directly with Standard Model fields through the Higgs portal, and we calculate the thermal production (freeze-in) of WIMPzilla dark matter from the annihilation of Higgs boson pairs in the plasma. The two particle-physics model parameters are the WIMPzilla mass and the Higgs-WIMPzilla coupling. The two cosmological parameters are the reheating temperature and the expansion rate of the universe at the end of inflation. We delineate the regions of parameters space where either gravitational or thermal production is dominant, and within those regions we identify the parameters that predict the observed dark matter relic abundance. Allowing for thermal production opens up the parameter space, even for Planck-suppressed Higgs-WIMPzilla interactions.},
